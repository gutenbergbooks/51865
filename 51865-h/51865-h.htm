<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>This book was begun under the influence
of the enthusiasm aroused by President Wilson’s
address to Congress on January 22, 1917. It
was then that he first gave definite utterance of
his plan for a league, or federation, of nations to
establish a permanent peace. The idea had long
been before the world, but it was generally dismissed
as too impracticable for the support of
serious minded men. By taking it up the President
brought it into the realm of the possible.
In the presence of the great world catastrophe
that hung over us it seemed well to dare much
in order that we might avoid a repetition of
existing evils. And if the idea was worth trying,
it was certainly worth a careful examination in
the light of history. It was with the hope of
making such a careful examination that I set
to work on the line of thought that has led to
this book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
As my work has progressed the great drama
has been unfolding itself with terrible realism.
New characters have come upon the stage, characters
not contemplated in the original cast of
the play. At the same time some of the old
parts have undergone such changes that they
appear in new relations. I am not unmindful
of the fact that events now unforeseen may make
other and radical changes in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dramatis
personæ</i> before this book is placed in the hand
of the reader. But always the great problem
must be the same, the prevention of a return to
the present state of world madness. That end
we must ever keep in mind as we consider the
arguments here advanced, and any inconsistency
discovered between the argument and the actual
state of events will, I hope, be treated with as
much leniency as the transitions of the situation
seem to warrant.</p>

<p>As I write, many things indicate that the great
conflict is approaching dissolution. The exhaustion
of the nations, the awakening voices
of the masses, the evident failure of militarism
to lead Germany to world empire, the rising
spectre of the international solidarity of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
laborers, and many other portents seem to show
that the world will soon have to say “yes” or
“no” to the plain question: “Shall we, or shall
we not, have a union of nations to promote permanent
peace?”</p>

<p>The warning that they must answer the question
is shouted to many classes. Bankers are
threatened with the repudiation of the securities
of the greatest nations, manufacturers may soon
see their vast gains swallowed up in the destruction
of the forms of credit which hitherto have
seemed most substantial, churches and every
form of intellectual life that should promote
civilization may have their dearest ideals swept
away in a rush toward radicalism, and even the
German autocracy is fighting for its life against
an infuriated and despairing proletariat. Are
not these dangers enough to make us ask if the
old menace shall continue?</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to answer all the questions
I ask. It is sufficient to unfold the situation
and show how it has arisen out of the past.
If the reader finds that mistakes were once made,
he will have to consider the means of correcting
them. No pleader can compel the opinions of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
intelligent men and women. It is enough if he
lays the case before clear and conscientious minds
in an impersonal way. More than this he should
not try to do: as much as this I have sought to
do. If the world really lost the fruits of its
victory over a world conqueror at Waterloo, it is
for the citizen of today to say in what way the
lost fruits can be recovered.</p>

<p>Many friends have aided me in my efforts to
present my views to the public, and among them
Dr. Frederick P. Keppel, Dean of Columbia
University, deserves special acknowledgment. I
am also under obligation to Dean Ada C. Comstock,
of Smith College, for very careful proofreading.
But for the opinions here expressed
and the errors which may be discovered I alone
am responsible.</p>

<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>The nations of Europe fought a great war to a
finish a hundred and two years ago, defeating a
master leader of men and ending the ambitions
of a brilliantly organized nation. They were so
well satisfied with their achievement that they
imagined that peace, won after many years of
suffering, was a sufficient reward for their sacrifices.
To escape impending subjugation
seemed enough good fortune for the moment.
They forgot that it was a principle and not
merely a man they had been contending against,
and when they had made sure that Napoleon was
beyond the possibility of a return to power, they
thought the future was secure. But the principle
lived and has come to life again. It was
the inherent tendency to unification in government,
a principle that appeals to the national
pride of most peoples when they find themselves
in a position to make it operate to the supposed
advantage of their own country. It has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">x</a></span>
seized upon by the Germans in our own generation,
to whom it has been as glittering a prize as it
was to the Frenchmen of the early nineteenth
century. To conquer the world and win a place
in the sun is no mean ideal; and if the efforts of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> allies succeed in defeating it in its
present form, it is reasonably certain that it will
appear again to distress the future inhabitants of
the earth, unless sufficient steps are taken to
bind it down by bonds which cannot be broken.</p>

<p>This conviction has led to the suggestion that
when Germany is beaten, as she must be beaten,
steps should be taken, not only to insure that she
shall not again disturb the earth, but that no other
power coming after her shall lay the foundations
and form the ambition which will again put the
world to the necessity of fighting the present war
over again. When the North broke the bonds of
slavery in the South in 1865 it was filled with
a firm determination that slavery should stay
broken. In the same way, when the nations shall
have put down the menace of world domination
now rampant in Europe, they should make it their
first concern to devise a means by which the
menace shall stay broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
To kill a principle demands a principle equally
strong and inclusive. No one nation can keep
down war and subjugation; for it must be so
strong to carry out that purpose that it becomes
itself a conqueror. It would be as intolerable to
Germany, for example, to be ruled by the United
States as it would be to the United States if they
were ruled by Germany. The only restraint that
will satisfy all the nations will be exercised by
some organ of power in which all have fair representation
and in which no nation is able to do
things which stimulate jealousy and give grounds
for the belief that some are being exploited by
others. This suggestion does not demand a well
integrated federal government for all the functions
of the state but merely the adoption of a
system of coöperation with authority over the
outbreak of international war and strong enough
to make its will obeyed. It is federation for only
one purpose and such a purpose as will never
be brought into vital action as long as the federated
will is maintained at such a point of strength
and exercised with such a degree of fairness that
individual states will not question that will.</p>

<p>This principle of federated action for a specific<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
purpose was adopted by the United States in
1789, and though hailed by the practical statesmen
of Europe as an experiment, it has proved
the happiest form of government that has yet
been established over a vast territory in which are
divergent economic and social interests. In it
is much more integration than would exist in a
federated system to prevent war, where the
action of the central authority would be limited to
one main object. If it could be formed and put
into operation by the present generation, who
know so well what it costs to beat back the spectre
of world conquest it might pass through the preliminary
critical stages of its existence successfully.
At any rate, the world is full of the feeling
that such things may be possible, and it would
be unwise to dismiss the suggestion without giving
it fair and full consideration.</p>

<p>The discussion brings up what seems to be a
law of human activities, that as the ages run and
as men develop their minds they combine in
larger and larger units for carrying on the particular
thing they are interested in. And they
make these combinations by force or through
mutual agreement. We have before us the consideration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
of the most important form of this
unifying process, the unification of nations,
which has generally come through force, but
sometimes has come through agreement.</p>

<p>In recent industrial history is a parallel process
so well illustrating the point at issue that I
can not refrain from mentioning it. In his book,
<cite>My Four Years in Germany</cite>, Mr. James W.
Gerard contrasts great industrial combinations in
the United States and Germany. In one country
are trusts, in the other great companies
known as cartels. The development of the trust
we know well. It came out of a process of competitive
war. Some large manufacturer who
possessed ability for war, formed an initial group
of manufacturers with the prospect of controlling
a large part of the market. He was careful to
see that his own group had the best possible organization,
central control, and a loyal body of
subordinates. Then he opened his attack on his
smaller rivals, and in most cases they were driven
into surrender or bankruptcy. It was a hard
process, but it led to industrial unity with its
many advantages.</p>

<p>The cartel began with co-operation. All the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
persons or companies manufacturing a given
article were asked to unite in its creation. They
pooled their resources, adopted common buying
and selling agencies, and shared the returns
amicably. They proved very profitable for the
shareholders, and they strengthened the national
industry in its competition against foreigners.
In the United States the trust has been unpopular,
despite its many economic advantages. The
reason is the battle-like methods by which it destroyed
its rivals. The result was the enactment
of laws to restrain its development, laws so contrary
to the trend of the times that they have
been very tardily enforced. The cartel, established
with the co-operation of the whole group
of manufacturers, aroused no antagonism and
obtained the approval of the laws. It is not necessary
to say which is the better of these two
methods of arriving at the same object.</p>

<p>Turning to the subject with which we are here
chiefly concerned, it is interesting to note that
Germany has undertaken in the last years to
carry forward her world expansion by methods
that are entirely different. While she has federated
in industrial life she appears in her foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
relations as a true representative of the spirit
that built up the trusts. She means to unify
her competitor states, not as she has united her
industries, but as the American trusts secured the
whole field of operations. First she forms a
small group with herself at the head. In the
group are Germany, Austria, Turkey, and, later
on, Bulgaria. At this stage of her progress she
has gone as far as the Standard Oil Company had
gone when Mr. Rockefeller had perfected the
idea of the “trust” in 1882. Her next step was
to attack her rivals. France she would crush at
a blow, first lulling Great Britain to inactivity
by feigned friendship and the promise of gains
in the Near East. Then she would do what she
would with Russia. With these two nations disposed
of, Britain, the unready, could be easily
brought to terms, and the United States would
then be at her mercy. The mass of German people
had not, perhaps, reasoned the process out in
this way; but it was so easily seen that it could
not have escaped the minds of the leaders of the
German military party. No trust builder ever
made fairer plans for the upbuilding of his enterprise
than these gentlemen made for putting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
through their combination, before which they
saw in their minds the states of the world toppling.
So well were the plans made and so
efficient were the strokes that the utmost efforts
of the rest of the world have become necessary to
defeat the German hopes.</p>

<p>The United States have approached the problem
of world relations in another spirit. Rejecting
the spirit of the trust magnate, which
Germany accepted, we have turned to coöperation
as the means of avoiding international
competition and distrust. President Wilson’s
repeated suggestions of a federated peace are
couched in the exact spirit of the cartel. He
asks that war may be replaced by coöperation,
pointing out the tremendous advantage to all
if the machinery of competition can be discarded.</p>

<p>Viewed in its largest aspects, therefore, the
present struggle has resolved itself into a debate
over the amount of unity that shall in the future
exist between states. It does not seem possible
that Austria will ever be a thoroughly sovereign
state again, nor that Turkey will escape from
the snare in which her feet are caught. What
degree of unity this will engender between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
France and Great Britain, if the old system of
international relations continues, it is not hard
to guess. And as for the small states of Europe,
their future is very perplexing.</p>

<p>This much rests on the assumption that Germany
and her allied neighbours are going to
make peace without defeat and without victory.
If they should be able to carry off a triumph,
which now seems impossible, it would not be hard
to tell in what manner unification would come.
However the result, the separateness of European
states will probably be diminished, and
their interdependence, either in two large groupings
or in some more or less strong general
grouping, will be increased.</p>

<p>No wise man will undertake to say which form
of interdependence will be the result. But it
seems certain that we stand today with two roads
before us, each leading to the same end, a stronger
degree of unity. One goes by way of German
domination, the other by way of equal and mutual
agreement. I do not need to say which will be
pleasanter to those who travel. We cannot
stand at the crossing forever: some day we shall
pass down one of the roads. It is said that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
world is not yet ready to choose the second road,
and that it must go on in the old way, fighting
off attempts at domination, until it learns the
advantages of co-operation. It may be so; but
meanwhile it is a glorious privilege to strike a
blow, however weak, in behalf of reason.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE QUESTION OF PERMANENT PEACE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When war broke over the world three years
ago many ministers and other people declared
that Armageddon had come. They had in mind
a tradition founded on a part of the sixteenth
chapter of Revelations, in which the prophet was
supposed to describe a vision of the end of the
world. In that awful day seven angels appeared
with seven vials of wrath, and the contents of each
when poured out wiped away something that was
dear to the men of the earth. The sixth angel
poured out on the waters of the river Euphrates,
and they were dried up; and then unclean spirits
issued from the mouths of the dragons and of
other beasts and from the mouth of the false
prophet, and they went into the kings of the
earth, then the political rulers of mankind, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
induced them to bring the people together “to
the battle of that great day of God Almighty.”
And the armies met at Armageddon and fought
there the last battle of time. This striking figure
made a deep impression on the early Christians,
and out of it arose the belief that some
day would come a great and final war, in which
the nations of the earth would unite for their
mutual destruction, after which the spirit of
righteousness would establish a millennial reign
of peace. And so when most of the nations of
the world came together in war in 1914, many
persons pronounced the struggle the long expected
Armageddon.</p>

<p>It was easy to say in those days of excitement
that this war was going to be the last. Madness
it certainly was, and surely a mad world would
come back to reasonableness after a season of
brutal destruction. Common sense, humanity,
and the all powerful force of economic interest
would bring the struggle to an end, and then by
agreement steps would be taken to make a recurrence
of the situation impossible.</p>

<p>It was in the days when we still had confidence
in civilization. Humanity, we said, had developed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
to such an extent that it could not return to
the chaos that an age of war would imply. International
law was still considered a binding body
of morality, if not of actual law. International
public opinion was believed to have power to punish
national wrong-doers. We who teach said as
much to our classes many times in those days of
innocence. In all sincerity we felt that a nation
could not do this or that thing because public
opinion would not tolerate it. How far distant
seem now the days of early summer in 1914!</p>

<p>We had adopted many specific rules to restrain
needless barbarity in war. For example,
we would not use dum-dum bullets, nor drop
bombs on non-combatants, nor shell the homes of
innocent dwellers on the seashore. It was considered
an achievement of the civilized spirit that
an army occupying enemy territory would respect
the rights of the non-combatant inhabitants,
set guards over private property, protect women
and children from injury, and permit civilians to
go about their business as long as they did not intermeddle
with military matters. In three and
a half horrible years we have drifted a long
way from these protestations. Those of us who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
once studied the elements of international law
may well study them again when the war is over,
if, indeed, international law is still thought worth
studying.</p>

<p>In the vision the angel poured out his vial on
the great river, to the early men of Mesapotamia
the symbol of the great waters. In our own day
we have seen strange engines of wrath placed in
the great waters, foul spirits that destroy men
and ships in disregard of the rules of fair fighting.
And out of the mouths of dragons and other
loathsome beasts, and of false prophets as well,
evil spirits have issued in these sad days. They
have taken their places in the hearts and minds
of self-willed men and made beasts of them; so
that the rest of humanity have had to fight against
them and suffer themselves to be killed by them,
in order that the wicked shall not triumph over
the whole earth.</p>

<p>The war has been gruesome beyond the imagination
of man. No other recorded experience
has told us of so much killing, and of so many
different ways of killing. Men have been slain
with swords, cannon, great howitzers, rifles,
machine guns, tanks, liquid fire, electrified wires,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
and finally with the germs of disease deliberately
planted. Nothing that science could invent for
destroying human life has been omitted, except,
possibly, dum-dum bullets; and in view of the
use of much more cruel means we may well ask,
“Why not dum-dums also?”</p>

<p>We must admit that if the author of the Book
of Revelations had prophetic insight and foresaw
the world struggle that now is, he did not overpaint
its terrors. And so, asks the man of faith,
if the first part of the vision comes true, why
may not the second part likewise come true?
If the seer could foresee the war and its horrors,
may he not also have spoken truly when he foretold
that after Armageddon wars would be no
more; for God would wipe away the desire for
them from the hearts of men?</p>

<p>To this question I answer: If a man is left
in the world when this conflict is ended who
glories in deliberate war, he is too bad to live in
civilized society. Certain it is that the vast
majority of men and women are already convinced
that the desire for war, henceforth and
forever, is wiped out of their hearts. In the
stress of actual battle or in the preparations to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
sustain those who fight they may forget the
fundamental folly of the whole thing for the time;
but it is always at the bottom of their hearts.
What is the human power of reasoning worth,
if it is not able to devise some way to escape
from this obsession of self-slaughter?</p>

<p>Do not be deceived by the strut of Mars. His
<em>Day</em> has come with a vengeance. He has shot
up rapidly, like a jimson-weed, and blossomed
like a cactus. We may have laughed at him in
the days of peace, but we now look to him for
protection. We cannot decry the men who are
dying for us, dying in the best sportsmanslike
manner. But we do not like their business as a
business, and we wish at the bottom of our hearts
that it were abolished as a peril to humanity.
And we believe that of all who hate war, none
hate it more than those who are actually fighting
in this struggle. Let us give Mars his <em>Day</em> and
all the glory that belongs to it, but let us not
forget peace while we serve war.</p>

<p>Nor should we be deceived by the pallid pacifist.
He has his counterpart in every struggle;
and in general he serves some good purpose in
a multitude of opinions. But the day of stress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
and world crisis is not his <em>Day</em>; and the practical
world loses little time in putting him in his place.
The pacifist does not represent the peace movement
in its freest and most significant form.
The advocates of peace today who are best serving
its promotion are those who are out in the
armies bent on putting down that nation who is
the most dangerous enemy of peace.</p>

<p>These men are not mere pieces of machinery
in a great driving process. They are thinking
men with political power in their hands, either
actually or potentially. War is a great schoolteacher.
It has lasted in our own time nearly as
long as a course in college. The soldiers who
survive from the beginning of this conflict may
now be considered as more than half through
their senior year. They know what war is and
what it means, and they know something about
the necessary form of coöperation that must
exist in any society before the will of the people
can be carried into effect. They knew little
about war four years ago: they now know all the
professors know. Behind the lines and here in
our homes one never sees man nor woman who
does not admit that it would be a blessing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
make war impossible; but few of us have any idea
how to go about getting it made impossible.
Many of us think we shall never get people to
act together in such a cause. But it seems unreasonable
to expect that men who have raided
through “No Man’s Land,” captured trenches
and defeated great armies through organization
and initiative should quail before the inertia
of opinion, perhaps the chief obstacle confronting
those who labor for a coöperative peace.</p>

<p>The example of the Russians is a useful point
in this connection. At the beginning of the war
their armies were as machine-like as any armies
could be. The privates were generally peasants
who did not know why they fought, and who certainly
had nothing to say about the origin of the
war. They were typical “cannon-fodder,” and
as unthinking as any modern soldier can be.
They have learned much from less than three
years of war. They slowly acquired purpose,
a sense of organization, and leaders whom they
follow. Having made this progress they overthrew
the imperial government, drove away the
great nobles, put an ensign in the place of a
former grand duke and two exiles in the seats<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of the highest officials, and stripped the highest
born army officers of their titles and insignia.</p>

<p>At the present writing they are holding out
against all attempts to overthrow them, they are
playing the diplomatic game with Germany
without discredit,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> and they are reported to be
shaking the foundations of autocracy in Austria.
At any rate, it must be confessed that a small
group of the Russian “cannon-fodder” have
made commendable progress in the process of
education during the last ten months. The
process seems to have been under the direction
of the socialists, a small but well organized group
of intelligent persons who do not lack initiative.
It is they who are educating the Russian peasants
into political self-expression.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Since the above was written events have occurred in Russia
which seem to discredit the diplomacy of the revolutionists; but
the general situation is so unsettled that no conclusions can be
drawn at this time, February 27, 1918.</p></div>

<p>The possible results of this incident are tremendous.
Nowhere else in the world have the
agricultural classes fallen into one party with
vigorous and trained leaders. If Russia is now
embarking on an era of representative government,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
as seems probable, she is passing through
a stage in which political parties are being
crystallized. So far, it does not appear that any
considerable party is organized in the vast empire
on what we should call a conservative basis. It
will be an interesting experiment in political
history if Russia has a great peasant party in
control of the administration.</p>

<p>The party that now controls Russia is committed
to the idea of a peace through the coöperation
of the nations. It is true that internationalism
goes further than mere federation of
nations; for it also implies the socialization of industry,
the equal distribution of property. In
short, it is the internationalism and unification of
the industrial classes in all nations for a combined
opposition to capital. With these aims
we shall, probably, not be pleased. But they
imply the destruction of war; and it now seems
possible that Russia will stand before the world,
at least until the radical elements fall before
conservatives, as the most prominent champion
of coöperative peace.</p>

<p>As to the socialistic purpose of the internationalists,
it stands apart logically from that feature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
of their doctrine that relates to the mere
coöperation of nations. They would say, probably,
that coöperation is but incidental to their
main desire, the unification of the workers of
the world. But it is right to expect that they
would support coöperation among the nations
to obtain the destruction of war, since it would
make it easier for the world to accept their other
ideals. On the other hand the man who opposes
internationalism as such, could accept the aid of
a radical Russia in obtaining federated peace,
without feeling that in doing so he was necessarily
contributing to the promotion of the socialistic
features of internationalism.</p>

<p>This remarkable shifting of power in Russia
has had its counterpart on a less impressive scale
in other countries. Whether it comes to the
point of explosion or not, there is in the minds
of all&mdash;the thoughtful people, the working-men,
and all intermediate classes&mdash;a growing belief
that a new idea should rule the relations of
nations among themselves. From an age of international
competition they are turning to the
hope of an era of international agreement; and
it does not appear that their influence will be unheeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
when men come to face steadily the
problems the war is sure to leave behind it.</p>

<p>Most notable influence of all in behalf of a
federated peace is the position taken by President
Wilson. In the beginning of this conflict
he had the scholar’s horror of warfare, and he has
taken more than one opportunity to suggest the
formation of a league of nations to prevent the
outbreak of future wars. His address to Congress
on January 22, 1917, was a notable presentation
of the idea to the world. Enthusiastic
hearers pronounced the occasion a turning-point
in history. Whether a league of nations is established
or not, according to the president’s
desires, his support of the idea has given it a
great push forward. He has taken it out of the
realm of the ideal and made it a practical thing,
to be discussed gravely in the cabinets of rulers.</p>

<p>A year after the question has been brought
forward, it should be possible to form an opinion
of the attitude of European nations in regard
to the suggestion. From all of them, including
Germany and Austria, have come courteous
allusions to the idea of the president; and the
pope has given it his support. But it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
clear that all are sincerely in favor of a logically
constituted league that will have power to do
what it is expected to do. That President Wilson
will continue to urge steps in this direction
is to be taken as certain. The measure of his
success will be the amount of hearty and substantial
support he has from that large class of
people who still ask: “Can’t something be done
to stop war forever?”</p>

<p>When this page is being written the newspapers
are full of a discussion of the two speeches
that came from the central powers on January
25, 1918, one from Chancellor von Hertling of
Germany, and the other from Count Czernin, of
Austria. In the former is the following utterance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I am sympathetically disposed, as my political activity
shows, toward every idea which eliminates for the future
a possibility or a probability of war, and will promote
a peaceful and harmonious collaboration of nations. If the
idea of a bond of nations, as suggested by President
Wilson, proves on closer examination really to be conceived
in a spirit of complete justice and complete impartiality
toward all, then the imperial government is gladly ready,
when all other pending questions have been settled, to
begin the examination of the basis of such a bond of nations.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
This very guarded utterance means much or
little, as the German rulers may hereafter determine.
By offering impossible conditions of what
they may pronounce “complete justice and complete
impartiality to all” they may be able to
nullify whatever promise may be incorporated in
it. On the other hand, the sentiment, if accepted
in a fair spirit and without exaggerated demands,
may be a real step toward realizing President
Wilson’s desires. If, for example, Germany
should insist, as a condition for the formation
of a “bond of nations,” that Great Britain give
up her navy, or dismantle Gibraltar, while she
herself retained her immense Krupp works and
her power to assemble her army at a moment’s
notice, it is hardly likely the demand would be
granted. We can best know what Germany
will do in this matter when we see to what extent
she is willing to acknowledge that her war
is a failure and that her military policy is a
vast and expensive affair that profits nothing.
Moreover, there is a slight sneer in the chancellor’s
words, as though he does not consider the
president’s idea entirely within the range of the
diplomacy of experienced statesmen; and this is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
not very promising for the outcome&mdash;unless,
indeed, the logic of future events opens his eyes
to the meaning of the new spirit that the war has
aroused.</p>

<p>Among our own allies the suggestion of our
president has found a kinder reception. Mr.
Lloyd George has announced his general support
of the proposition, and Lord Bryce and others
have given it cordial indorsement. It seems
that if the United States urges the formation
of a league of peace, she will have the coöperation
of Great Britain. As to the position of
France and Italy, the matter is not so clear.
They probably are too deeply impressed by the
danger they will ever face from powerful neighbors
to feel warranted in dismissing their armies,
unless the best assurance is given that Germany
and Austria accept federated peace in all good
faith.</p>

<p>As the contending nations approach that state
of exhaustion which presages an end of the war,
the question of such a peace becomes increasingly
important. Everything points to the conclusion
that the time has arrived to debate this subject.
If the hopes of August, 1914, that Armageddon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
would be succeeded by an era of permanent
peace are to be realized, they will not come without
the serious thought of men who are willing
to dare something for their ideals. And if they
come out of the present cataclysm it is time to
be up and doing. The sentiment that exists in
this country, and in other countries, must be
organized and made effective at the critical
moment. There is nothing more dispiriting to
the student of history than to observe as he reads
how many favorable moments for turning some
happy corner in the progress of humanity were
allowed to pass without effort to utilize them.
It has been a hundred years since the world had
another opportunity like this that faces us, and
if it is not now tried out to the utmost possibility,
there is little hope that the next century will be as
bloodless as the past has been, even with the
present conflict included.</p>

<p>Every general war in Europe since the days
of the Roman Empire has brought humanity
there to a state of exhaustion similar to that
which now exists. So it was with the Thirty
Years’ War, with the wars inaugurated by Louis
XIV to establish the predominance of France,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
and with the Napoleonic wars a century ago.
Each of these struggles, it will be observed, extended
to a larger portion of Europe than its
predecessor; and it was because the common interests
of nations were progressively stronger;
for it was ever becoming so that what concerned
one state concerned others. In the present war
the interrelations of nations is such that Japan
and the United States have been brought into the
conflict, along with China and several of the
smaller American states. If the conflict recurs
in the future it may be expected to involve a
still wider area.</p>

<p>There is evidence that in each of these struggles
the humane men then living were filled with
the same longing for permanent peace that many
men feel today.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The feeling was especially
strong during the last stages of the Napoleonic
wars and immediately after they ended. Singularly
enough it was strongest in Russia, due, however
to the accident that an enthusiastic and
idealistic tsar was ruling in that country. He
had received his ideals from a French tutor who
was deeply imbued with the equality theories<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
of the revolution that swept over his own country.
The tsar accepted them with sincerity and spent
several years of conscientious effort in his attempts
to have them adopted. More singularly
still, they found their only sincere indorsement,
among the rulers who had the right to indorse or
reject, with the king of Prussia, who at that time
was a very religious man. Most peculiar of all
they found very strong opposition in England,
where practical statesmen were in power. As I
read the history of that day and reflect on what
has been the train of events from the battle of
Waterloo to the invasion of Belgium in 1914, it
is hard to keep from wishing that a better effort
had been made in 1815 to carry out the suggestion
which the tsar urged on his royal brothers
in Europe.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> See below, pp. <a href="#Page_46">46&ndash;62</a>.</p></div>

<p>The defeat of Napoleon was purchased at immense
sacrifices. To the people of the day the
most desirable thing in the world seemed to be a
prevention of his reappearance to trouble mankind.
They took the greatest care to keep his
body a prisoner until he was dead; but they did
not seriously try to lay his ghost. Probably
they did not think, being practical men, that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
spirit would walk again in the earth. They
were mistaken; for not only has the ghost come
back, but it has come with increased power and
subtlety. In fact, it was an old ghost, and having
once inhabited the bodies of Louis XIV, Augustus
Cæsar, and Alexander of Macedon, as well as
that of Napoleon I, it knew much more than
the grave gentlemen who undertook to arrange
the future of Europe in practical ways in 1815.</p>

<p>As we approach again the re-making of our
relations after a world war, it is worth while to
glance over the things that were done in 1815, to
understand what choice of events was presented
to the men of that day, and what results came
from the course they deliberately decided to
follow. Thus we may know whether or not the
course proved a happy one, and whether or not
it is the course that we, also, should follow. And
if it is not such a course, we ought as thinking
people to try to adopt a better.</p>

<p>We should always remember that the conditions
of today are more suitable to a wise decision
than the conditions of 1815. We have, for one
thing, the advantage of the experience of the
past hundred years. There is no doubt in our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
minds as to how the old plan has worked and
how it may be expected to work if again followed.
It led to the Concert of Europe and the Balance
of Power, both of which served in certain emergencies,
but failed in the hour of supreme need.
Indeed, it is probable that they promoted the
crash that at last arrived.</p>

<p>Another advantage is that we have today in
the world a vastly greater amount of democracy
than in 1815. The people who pay the bills of
Mars today can say what shall be done about
keeping Mars in chains; and that is something
they could not do in 1815. It is for them to know
all his capers, and his clever ways of getting out
of prison, and to look under his shining armor to
see the grizzly hairs that cover his capacious ribs;
and having done this to decide what will be their
attitude toward him.</p>

<p>It is not the business of an author to offer
his views to his reader ready made. Enough if
he offers the material facts out of which the
reader may form his own opinions. That is my
object in this book. I do not disguise my conviction
that some of the fruits of the war that
ended at Waterloo were lost through the inexperience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
of the men who set the world on its
course again. Whether or not the men were as
wise as they should have been is now a profitless
inquiry. My only object is to set before
the reader as clearly as I can the idea of a permanent
peace through federated action, to show
how that idea came up in connection with the
war against Napoleon, how it was rejected for a
concerted and balanced international system,
what came of the decision in the century that
followed, and finally in what way the failure of
the old system is responsible for the present war.
If the reader will follow me through these considerations,
he will be prepared to examine in a
judicial spirit the arguments for and against
President Wilson’s suggested union of nations
to end war.</p>

<p>As these introductory remarks are written, we
seem to be girding up our loins again with the
firm conviction that we cannot talk of peace until
Germany knows she is beaten. The decision is
eminently wise. But if it is worth while to fight
two or ten years more to crush Germany’s confidence
in her military policy, how much ought it
not to be worth to make the nations realize that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
if they really wish to destroy war they can do
it by taking two steps: first, end this struggle
in a spirit of amity; and second, make an effective
agreement to preserve that state of amity by preventing
the occurrence of the things and feelings
that disturb it. That is the task as well as the
opportunity of wise men, who can govern themselves;
and it is for their information that this
volume is written which undertakes to point out
“The Lost Fruits of Waterloo” and the conditions
under which we may seek to recover them.
It is not a book of propaganda, unless facts are
propagandists. It is not a pacifist book, although
its pages may make for peace, if God
wills. It is only a plain statement of the lessons
of history as they appear to one of the many
thousands of puzzled persons now habitants of
this globe who are trying to grope their ways out
of this fog of folly.</p>

<span class="subhead">EARLY ADVOCATES OF UNIVERSAL PEACE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Those who have tried to point the world to
universal peace may be divided into two schools:
one advocating a form of coöperation in which
the final reliance is to be reason, the other looking
forward to some effective form of common action
behind which shall be sufficient force to carry
out the measures necessary to enforce the common
will. It is convenient to describe the former
group as advocating a league of peace, since we
are generally agreed that a league is a form of
concert from which the constituent members may
withdraw at will, and in which does not reside
power to force them to do what they do not find
reasonable. The second group wish to have a
federation, if by that term we understand a united
group in which exists power sufficient to preserve
the common cause against any possible
disobedient member. To form a league is easier
than to form a federation. States are tenacious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
of sovereignty. The Swiss cantons, the Dutch
provinces, and the original thirteen states of
North America are the most striking illustrations
of states that were willing to submit themselves
to the more strenuous process of union. They
acted under stress of great common peril, and
their first steps in federation were short and
timid; but none of them have regretted that the
steps were taken. It was the good fortune of
these groups of states that they were able to
unite at the proper time and that their actions
were not overclouded by the counsel of “practical
statesmen” to whom ideals were things to
be distrusted.</p>

<p>In other states in periods of great distress from
war men lived who dreamed of coöperation to
promote peace, but their voices were too weak for
the times. The most notable early advocate of
this scheme was the Duke of Sully, if we may
accept the notion that he wrote the work known
as the <cite>Grand Design</cite> of Henry IV. In that
plan was contemplated a Christian Republic,
composed of fifteen states in Europe, only three
of which were to have a republican form of government.
They were to give up warring among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
themselves and to refer to a common council,
modeled on the Ionic League, all matters of
interstate relation that were of importance to
the “very Christian Republic.” The only war
this republic was to wage was the common war
to expel the Turks from Europe. It was after
Henry’s death that Sully published the plan with
the assertion that his former master had formed
it just after the treaty of Vervins, 1598.</p>

<p>Whether it was the work of king or duke, no
attempt was made to put it into force. In 1598
Europe was in the throes of a long and hopeless
struggle for religion. Cities were destroyed,
men and women were butchered, and the safety
of states was threatened. The <cite>Grand Design</cite>
represents the reaction of either Henry’s or
Sully’s mind against such a terror. It was a
thing to be desired, if it could have been attained.
One of the marks of peace that it displayed was
the attitude it took towards the branches of the
Christian faith. Complete tolerance was to
exist for the three forms, Catholicism, Lutheranism,
and Calvinism. This was a kind of idealism
that was then unattainable; but in the course of
time it has been achieved. I should not like to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
say the day will not come when the other side of
the scheme, interstate peace, will also cease to be
too ideal for realization.</p>

<p>The next important suggestion of union for
peace was made by William Penn in 1693 in an
<cite>Essay towards the Present and Future Peace of
Europe</cite>. At that time the Continent was racked
with war&mdash;a result of the ambition of Louis XIV
to raise France to a dominating position among
the other nations&mdash;, the Palatinate had been devastated,
and the will of the “Grand Monarch”
was the dreaded fact in international politics.
Penn realized that great sacrifices were ahead;
for it was as true then as now that when a strong
state rises to a position in which it can threaten
universal rule, there is nothing for the other
states but to combine and fight as long as they
can.</p>

<p>Penn’s proposal was that the sovereigns of
Europe should form a Great Diet in which all
their disputes should be adjusted. If any
state refused to submit to the judgment of the
diet and appealed to arms, all the other states
were to fall upon it with their armies and make
it rue the course it had taken. Quaker though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
he was, he would have war to prevent war. His
proposal made no impression on his “practical”
contemporaries; but he was prepared for that.
Men of his faith were used to “bearing testimony”
in the expectation that “the world” would
scoff. Although it was not included in the original
folio edition of his works this essay remains
to this day the best known thing he wrote. It
is one of the most logical arguments for peace
that we have.</p>

<p>From 1701 to 1714 was waged the War of
the Spanish Succession, the last of the series of
struggles in which Louis XIV wore out his kingdom
in trying to make it supreme over its neighbors.
It left France exhausted and miserable,
and it had not realized the king’s ambition.
In 1713, the year in which Louis was forced to
accept the Treaty of Utrecht in token of his
defeat, was published by the Abbé Castel de St.
Pierre a book called <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Projet de Traité pour rendre
la Paix Perpetuelle</cite>. Like the utterances of
Sully and Penn, it was wrung out of the mind of
the author by the ruin that lay around him. It
differed from them in nothing but in its more
abundant details. The abbé had taken many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
things into account, and the union of nations that
he proposed was to do six important things.</p>

<p>1. There was to be a perpetual alliance of
European rulers with a diet composed of plenipotentiary
agents in which disputed points were
to be settled amicably. 2. What sovereigns
were to be admitted to the alliance was to be determined
by the act of alliance, which was also
to fix the proportion in which each should contribute
to the common fund. 3. The union
was to guarantee the sovereignty of the constituent
states with existing boundaries, and
future disputes of this nature were to be referred
to the arbitration of the council. 4. States
offending against the laws of the diet were to be
put under the ban of Europe. 5. A state under
the ban was to be coërced by the other states
until it accepted the laws it had violated. 6. The
council was to make such laws, on instruction
from the sovereigns, as were thought necessary
to the objects for which the perpetual alliance
was created.</p>

<p>Like the two preceding plans the abbé’s scheme
was too strong to be rated as a league. It does
not allow us to think that a state could withdraw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
at pleasure from the alliance; and it gave to the
council the authority to lay taxes, make laws that
were binding, and punish defiant members. It
is noteworthy for the large amount of power it
gave to the sovereigns, since the members of the
council were their agents and acted only on instructions.
Under the prevalent notions of the
divine right of kings no other method of selecting
the members of the council would have been
considered in France, Spain, or Germany. On
the other hand, the abbé’s scheme was less liberal
in this respect than Penn’s, which provided that
the wisest and justest men in each nation should
be sent to the council. It was also a part of
Penn’s plan that the council should be a really
deliberative body, a parliament of Europe as
truly as there was in England a parliament of the
realm.</p>

<p>We have no evidence that the arguments of the
good abbé made a profound impression upon
any of the sovereigns upon whose favor the
scheme depended. The Treaty of Utrecht was
followed by a season of peace. So deeply
wounded was Europe by conflict that it had no
stomach for war during a generation. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
time of great industrial prosperity in England,
France, and Prussia. Walpole, the wise guardian
of peaceful society, dominated the first of
these nations, Fleury, also a man of peace, was
for a large part of the time the guiding hand
in the second, and Frederic William I directed
the development of the third with a sure sense of
economy and the efficient use of resources. At
the same time Austria was under the direction of
Charles VI, a peaceful monarch who had too
many anxieties at home to think of wars against
the Christian sovereigns around him. The small
struggles that occurred were without significance;
and it was not until 1740, when a new
generation was on the scene, that Europe again
had a period of general war, precipitated by an
imaginative young king who could not resist
the temptation to use the excellent tool with
which his father had provided him. Out of the
twenty years’ struggle that now followed, no
new plan arose for a system of coöperation to
secure peace, but one of the great philosophers
of the time made a new statement of the Abbé
St. Pierre’s plan, which served as a new proposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
It was during the last years of the Seven
Years’ War that Rousseau received the papers
of the good abbé, with the expectation that he
would prepare them for publication in a more
popular form than the twenty-one volumes in
which the author’s thoughts were buried. He
eventually gave up the task, but he produced two
short summaries, one of which was entitled
<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Extrait du Projet de Paix perpetuelle de M.
L’Abbé de Saint-Pierre</cite>. The “extract” proper
was followed by a “judgment” in which Rousseau
voiced his own views. He advocated the creation
of a confederacy mutually dependent, no state to
be permitted to resist all the other states united
nor to form an alliance with any other state in
rivalry with the confederacy. The scope of the
central authority was defined, and there was to
be a legislature to make laws in amplification
of that authority, such laws to be administered
by a federal court. No state was to withdraw
from the union. Thus, Rousseau made his proposed
confederacy rest on force. In his mind it
was to be vitally efficient government, capable
of doing all it was created to do.</p>

<p>All the plans I have mentioned contemplated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the creation of a central authority strong enough
to make itself obeyed. They implied, therefore,
that each constituent state should relinquish a
part of its sovereignty in order to form the federation.
Now this was, as at the present time, a
strong objection to the scheme. No one has met
it better than William Penn, who said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I am come now to the last Objection, <em>That Sovereign
Princes and States will hereby become not Sovereign: a
Thing they will never endure</em>. But this also, under Correction,
is a Mistake, for they remain as Sovereign at Home
as ever they were. Neither their Power over their People,
nor the usual Revenue they pay them, is diminished: It
may be the War Establishment may be reduced, which will
indeed of Course follow, or be better employed to the Advantage
of the Publick. So that the <em>Soveraignties</em> are as
they were, for none of them have now any Soveraignty
over one another: And if this be called a lessening of their
Power, it must be only because the great Fish can no
longer eat up the little ones, and that each Soveraignty is
<em>equally defended</em> from Injuries, and disabled from committing
them.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A quarter of a century later, in the beginning
of the French Revolution, Jeremy Bentham, the
English philosopher, advocated the union of
states in behalf of common peace, but he rested
his argument on morality, not on force. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
was to be a league of states, with a legislature
and courts of justice, but the decisions were to
be executed by the states themselves. He held
that after the court gave a decision in a specified
case and published the evidence and arguments,
public opinion would be strong enough to enforce
the judgment. By discarding force Bentham
had the advantage of preserving the sovereignty
of the states, a thing that is particularly
esteemed by an Englishman. He is to be considered
the first of a series of eminent peace
advocates who look no further than a league of
states bound together by their plighted word and
relying on the weight of public opinion to coërce
the individual states.</p>

<p>He had given his life to the task of fixing the
sway of law in the minds of humanity, and it was
a part of his general idea that a high court of justice,
investigating a controversy, and exposing
all the sides of it before a world of fair minded
observers, would lessen the asperity of opposing
passions so that the verdict of the court would be
received as saving credit and honor to the party
who had to yield. It is out of this attitude that
our whole doctrine of arbitration as an expedient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
for escaping war has its rise, a doctrine of such
importance in our general subject that no peace
advocate would dare reject it wholly.</p>

<p>Bentham’s opinion was expressed in a stray
pamphlet that made little impression in his time
and has nearly escaped the notice of posterity.
A more conspicuous achievement, and nearly
contemporary, was an essay by Immanuel Kant,
philosopher at Königsberg, in Prussia. In 1795
he published <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Zum ewigen Frieden</cite>, an outline for
a league of perpetual peace. There was a time,
he argued, when men lived by force under the
laws of nature, each regulating his own conduct
toward his neighbors, the strongest man having
his way through his ability to overawe his associates.
Then came the state and the rule of law,
and with their arrival one saw the exit of personal
combat. Kant applied the same argument to
the intercourse of the nations, saying they were
in a state of nature toward one another. He
proposed to organize a super-state over them,
with authority to bring them under a law prohibiting
wars among themselves. He would assign
a definite field of action to the new power,
with the function of making laws in enforcing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
that authority, and it would have the necessary
administrative and judicial officers. The
law made by the united government was to be as
good law for its own purposes as the law made
by the individual states for their purposes.</p>

<p>Kant’s suggestion was closely kin to Rousseau’s
ideas of the state, but he wrote at a time
when the world, stampeded by the excesses of
the Jacobins, was turning away from all the political
theories that underlay the French Revolution.
It had no use for the idea that government
was the outcome of a social contract; and
if this idea was not accepted for the state itself,
how much less would it be accepted as a means of
organizing the international state! The world
suffered too much at the hands of Napoleon to
like ideas that were responsible for the very beginning
of the letting out of the waters. And
this was especially true in Prussia, where the foot
of the French conqueror was extremely heavy.</p>

<p>At the moment when Kant’s ideas were at
the height of unpopularity came the young
philosopher, Hegel, who announced a philosophical
view of war that pleased the governing
class of Prussia, bent on establishing a system<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
of military training that would be sufficient for a
redeemed country. He taught that war through
action burns away moral excrescences, purifies
the health of society, and stimulates the growth
of manly virtue. This idea became the basis of
much German reasoning, and it is not improbable
that its defenders in trying to discern the
virtues they argued for, were led to develop
them. But in their enthusiasm they came to exaggerate
these virtues into habits that were often
mere manifestations of an exalted egoism. As
to the claim that war burns up the effete products
of society, it may be met by the undeniable assertion
that it also burns much that is best. One
does not burn a city to destroy the vermin that
are in it.</p>

<p>The next attempt to bring about a system of
coöperation to secure peace among the nations
was the formation of the Holy Alliance, a futile
attempt to apply principles like those just described,
made by Alexander I, of Russia, at the
close of the Napoleonic wars. It is considered at
length in the chapter following this, where it
finds its proper setting. The extremely religious
spirit in which it was conceived was a drawback<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
to success, but it is not likely that it would have
fared better than it did fare, even if stripped of
all its pious fantasy, since the world was not
educated to its acceptance as a purely political
idea.</p>

<p>At this stage one must notice the development
of peace societies. Organized at first as local
bodies they were drawn together into national
organizations in the early decades of the nineteenth
century. It was in 1816 that such a
society was created in Great Britain, and in 1828
that the American Peace Society was formed out
of local societies in the United States. In the
same year was established at Geneva the first
peace society on the Continent, the second being
organized at Paris in 1841. The influence of
such societies was weak for a long time; but
within the past twenty years it has been much
stronger.</p>

<p>One of the most striking examples of the
prevalence of the peace idea in recent times is the
growing use of arbitration as a means of settling
international disputes. Another is the meeting
of the Hague conferences to promote peace.
The first was called by the tsar, Nicholas II, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
1899 and laid a broad outline of the work that
such conferences ought to do. A second assembled
in the year 1907, and a third was about
to convene when the Great War began in 1914.
The conferences devoted their strongest efforts
to the reduction of armaments and the checking
of militarism; but in each case they found the
German Empire planted boldly across their path,
and in this respect their efforts were futile. It
is not to be doubted that the attitude of Germany
contributed much to develop the widespread suspicion
of that country which has been one of her
handicaps in the present war.</p>

<p>The “peace movement,” as the totality of these
activities is called, has thus gained strength, and
it would seem that it must eventually prevail in
public opinion. It received an important momentum
in 1910, when Mr. Andrew Carnegie
gave $10,000,000 to establish the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, an organization
which has contributed powerfully to the promotion
of peace ideas. It acts on scientific
principles, seeking to gather and publish such
facts bearing on international relations, the laws<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of economics and history, and the science of international
law, as will show in what respect war
is to be removed from its hold on society.</p>

<p>The careless enthusiasm with which a great
many people hailed the outbreak of war in 1914
swept the peace advocates into the background
and was the occasion of some sarcasm at their
expense. But as the struggle grew in grimness
and horrors the advocates of peace on principle
returned to their old position in public esteem,
and have steadily gained on it. It seems undeniable
that the war has done more to convince
the world of the madness of war than many decades
of agitation could do.</p>

<p>One of the manifestations of the rebound
here mentioned was the organization in June,
1915, of “The League to Enforce Peace.” This
society was created in a meeting of representative
men assembled in Carpenters’ Hall, Philadelphia,
the place in which the Declaration of
Independence was adopted. Its principles are
embraced in the following proposals: 1. A
judicial tribunal to which will be referred judiciable
disputes between the signatory powers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
subject to existing treaties, the tribunals to have
power to pass on the merits of the disputes submitted
as well as on its jurisdiction over them.
2. The reference of other disputes between the
signatory states to a council of conciliation, which
will hear the cases submitted and recommend
settlements in accordance with its ideas of justice.
3. If any signatory state threatens war
before its case is submitted to the judicial tribunal
or the council of conciliation, the other
states will jointly employ diplomatic pressure to
prevent war; and if hostilities actually begin
under such circumstances they will jointly use
their military forces against the power in contempt
of the league. 4. The signatory states
will from time to time hold conferences to formulate
rules of international law which are to be
executed by the tribunal of arbitration unless
within a stated time some state vetoes the proposal.</p>

<p>The system of coöperation embodied in these
proposals is not a federation, within the meaning
that I have given to that term. It is what it
pretends to be, merely a league. It seems to
concede the right of a state to secede from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
league at will. As to what would happen under
it if a signatory state refusing to abide the decision
of the tribunal or council of conciliation should
attempt to withdraw and make war at once, we
can have little doubt. In such a case the attempt
to secede would probably be considered defiance
and steps be taken to reduce the state to submission.
Nevertheless it might happen that a
state within the league, finding its action restricted
so that it could not adopt some policy
which it considered essential to its welfare, might
proceed to withdraw in view of a line of conduct
it intended to take at a later time. In that case
it is difficult to see how the league could resist
unless it was willing to take the position that it
had a kind of sovereignty over all interstate relations,
a position that involves more concentration
than the form of the league seems to imply.</p>

<p>At this point in our inquiry into the subject of
coöperation to secure universal peace an inviting
field of speculation opens before us, but we must
turn aside for the time, in order to consider
various phases of the process by which the world
has arrived at the crisis now before it. This
chapter will serve its purpose if it gives the reader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
a view of the earliest suggestions of systems of
common action and if it makes clear the differences
between the two general plans that have
been formulated, the league and the federation.</p>

<span class="subhead">PROBLEMS OF THE NAPOLEONIC WARS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The career of Napoleon, which has long commanded
the greatest interest, not to say enthusiasm,
of students of history, aroused grave
fears in the minds of most of the thoughtful
men of his day who did not live in France. His
design to conquer all his neighbors was most
evident, and his apparent ability to carry it into
execution caused him to be regarded as the embodiment
of greed and insatiable ambition.
Not since the days of Louis XIV had Europe
felt such thrills of danger and horror. All its
energy was called into play to withstand his attacks.
Wars followed wars in a series of campaigns
that ended after many years of extreme
anxiety in his ruin, only when France had been
worn out by his repeated victories. When he
began his wars he was at the head of the best
prepared nation in the world. He struck with
sudden and vigorous blows against nations that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
were not united, defeating one after the other
with startling effect. Their lack of preparation
was most marked and was probably the most
effective cause of his initial success. After years
of conflict they learned how to oppose him.
From his own example they learned the value of
organization and method in fighting, and from
their own disasters they at last acquired the sense
of union that was necessary to give him the final
blow that made him no longer a menace to their
national integrity. It was not until 1815 that he
was finally defeated and reduced to the state of
ineffective personal power from which he had
risen.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the struggle he was to
his opponents the incarnation of all that was
hateful in government. Few of the epithets
now hurled at the kaiser were not as lavishly cast
at Napoleon. He was tyrant, robber, brute, and
murderer in turn, and it was pronounced a service
to humanity to suppress him. In the beginning
of the wars his pretensions were treated with
disdain, but as his victories followed one another
in bewildering rapidity, his power was treated
with more respect, although there was no greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
disposition to contemplate his triumph with complacency.
As the struggle became fiercer, the
other states than France began to think of some
permanent form of coöperation for restraining
him; and they even began to speculate on the
possibility of some permanent arrangement by
which the world might be saved from a recurrence
of such a vast waste of life and treasure as
was involved in the struggle. It was thus that
suggestions were made during the Napoleonic
era for abolishing war through international effort.
For us, who are today burdened with the
ruin of a similar but more stupendous struggle,
these efforts have a special interest, and the space
of a single chapter is none too much to give to
their consideration.</p>

<p>It is singular that these plans should have
found their most conspicuous supporters in
the heads of the two governments most widely
apart with reference to the popular character
of their institutions. It was in autocratic
Russia that one found the most advanced idea
of dealing with the future, and in Great Britain,
the most liberal of the great powers, that the
most conservative design was held. Each plan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
was supported by the head of these two governments
respectively, each ran through its
own development while the armies were locked
in deadly struggle, and each was debated with
seriousness in the moment of victory when the
statesmen of the winning powers met to arrange
for the future relations of the states whose
victories made them the arbiters of Europe.</p>

<p>The initiative was taken by Alexander I, of
Russia. He was a man of the best intentions,
and throughout the period with which we are
now dealing he showed himself persistently favorable
to views which, to say the least, were a
hundred years ahead of his time. By temperament
he was imaginative and sympathetic. In
his personal life were irregularities, but not as
many as in Napoleon’s, Louis XIV’s, or Talleyrand’s.
He lacked the royal vice of despotism,
and his escape from it was probably due to the
influence of Fréderic César de La Harpe, an
instructor of his youth, who arrived in Russia
with his head full of the dynamic ideas of the
French philosophers of the pre-revolutionary
period.</p>

<p>While “liberty, equality, and fraternity” maddened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
France, long oppressed by the dull repression
of the ancient régime, La Harpe was converting
his royal pupil to the doctrine of the
“Rights of Man.” So well was the lesson taught
that a long series of encounters with the solid
wall of Russian autocracy was necessary before
the pupil ceased to try to do something to
ameliorate the condition of his people. Historians
have called Alexander a dreamer, but
what is a man to do who is born a tsar and has
the misfortune to believe in the doctrines for
which we honor Lincoln and Jefferson? I am
willing to call him impractical, but I cannot withhold
sympathy from a man who tried, as he, to
strike blows in behalf of the forms of government
which makes my own country a home of liberty.</p>

<p>Alexander I came to the throne of Russia in
1801, anxious to carry out his liberal plans.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> In
1804, through his minister in London, he suggested
to Pitt, the prime minister, a plan for
settling the affairs of Europe after the defeat of
Napoleon. France, he said, must be made to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
realize that the allies did not war against her
people but against Napoleon, from whose false
power they proposed to set her free. Once liberated
she was to be allowed to choose any government
she desired. From La Harpe he had
imbibed a deep repugnance to the government of
the Bourbons, and in all his future discussions
of the subject he showed no enthusiasm for restoring
that line to their throne.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> For an excellent treatment of the events discussed in this
chapter see W.&nbsp;A. Phillips, <cite>The Confederation of Europe</cite>, London,
1914.</p></div>

<p>One of the charges often made by the allies
was that Napoleon overthrew international law.
It was a part of Alexander’s plan to reëstablish
its potency and to have the nations see to it that
no future violations of it could occur. He also
suggested that the firm agreement then existing
between Russia and Great Britain should continue
after the establishment of peace and that
other great powers should be brought into it so
that there should be a means of securing common
action in affairs of mutual significance. At this
time he had not, it seems, fully determined just
what form of coöperation ought to be adopted,
but in the suggestion of 1804 can be found the
germ of all his later designs for permanent peace.</p>

<p>At that moment Pitt was looking for the renewal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
of the European war and he expected the
formation of the great coalition of 1805, in which
Russia, Great Britain, Austria, and Sweden undertook
to defeat France. He did not dare,
therefore, reject the tsar’s proposals outright.
He gave approval to the suggestion in regard to
the restoration of international law, but he qualified
his sanction of the scheme for a future league
of nations. Napoleon crushed, he said, it would
be for the states to guarantee such an adjustment
of European affairs as they should agree upon in
solemn treaty. Looking into these two statements
it is seen that the tsar had in mind the
formation of some kind of league of nations,
with well defined powers and duties, while Pitt
looked forward to that kind of international coöperation
which was later described by the term
“Concert of Europe.” In the subsequent dealing
of Alexander with the British leaders over
this matter there was always this difference between
them.</p>

<p>In 1807 Napoleon won the battle of Friedland
over Russia and occupied a large part of the
tsar’s domain. Then came the Treaty of Tilsit
in which Alexander and Napoleon standing face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
to face came to an unexpected agreement to
divide the accessible part of the world between
them, Alexander ruling one half and Napoleon
ruling the other. It is certain, however, that
the tsar had in his mind that both he and his new
ally would rule their respective halves in the
spirit of La Harpe’s teaching. Napoleon baited
his trap with no less attractive a morsel than
self-government under a wise monarch in order
to catch Alexander I.</p>

<p>The Moscow campaign brought the tsar to his
senses. He himself said that it was the burning
of the ancient city, 1812, that illuminated his
mind and enabled him to see the true character of
the Corsican. For five years he had been lulled
into inactivity by the belief that some form of permanent
peace was coming to the world through
Napoleon. He now realized that he had been
duped, and after making due acknowledgment
of his error turned to the task of destroying the
deceiver. From that time he did not waver in his
determination.</p>

<p>Russia and Great Britain were thus in close
alliance, and immediately began consideration of
a permanent alliance looking toward a regulation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
of affairs in Europe after the war was ended.
The British cabinet took up the question and in
1813 passed a resolution in which occurs the following
declaration: “The Treaty of Alliance
[between the states which were united against
Napoleon] is not to terminate with the war, but
is to contain defensive engagements, with mutual
obligations to support the Power attacked by
France with a certain extent of stipulated succors.
The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">casus foederis</i> is to be an attack by
France on the European dominions of any one
of the contracting parties.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> This provision was
kept secret for the time, but it remained the
basis of the British policy throughout the negotiations
that followed. Castlereagh, in ability and
character the greatest statesman of his day, was
then at the head of the British cabinet, and it
seems certain that he inspired its policy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Phillips, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, 67.</p></div>

<p>He was already suspicious of the position of
the tsar in reference to France. That sovereign
had in no way relaxed his friendship for the
French people. Hating the Bourbons he would
have prevented their restoration to the throne,
and he had a project for allowing the French to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
determine whom they would have for king after
Napoleon. If he could carry this plan through
he would make himself very popular in France
and would have a strong position with the ruler
whose selection he should thus make possible.
To Castlereagh this was nothing but a shrewd
piece of policy for laying the foundation of a
Franco-Russian alliance which would have overweening
influence in Europe, and he set himself
against its execution. He was forced to proceed
cautiously, however, since Napoleon was not
beaten and the aid of the tsar was essential.
There is nothing to suggest that Alexander did
not entertain his French views in all singleness
of purpose. The worst his enemies said of him
was that he was a dreamer; but he was not given
to a policy of calculation.</p>

<p>To thwart Alexander and carry through his
own views Castlereagh set himself to “group” the
tsar, that is, to draw him into an agreement with
other sovereigns in which such a policy was accepted
as would serve to deflect the whole group
of allies from the direct course which the tsar
would have followed if left alone. Early in
1814 a treaty was signed at Chaumont by Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia in which all
the problems then before the allies were taken
up. The sixteenth article of the treaty dealt
with the point which had caused Castlereagh so
much anxiety. It ran:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The present Treaty of Alliance having for its object
the maintenance of the Balance of Europe, to secure the repose
and independence of the Powers, and to prevent the
invasions which for so many years have devastated the
world, the High Contracting Parties have agreed among
themselves to extend its duration for twenty years from
the date of signature, and they reserve the right of agreeing,
if circumstances demand it, three years before its
expiration, on its further prolongation.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Phillips, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, 78.</p></div>

<p>By this means Alexander was “grouped” with
his three allies in the support of a kind of coöperation
which was not what he had hitherto
insisted upon. It is probable that he did not
realize how completely he was outplayed, when
he was forced by the logic of events to set his
hand to a treaty that provided for the Concert
of Europe, and not for the league to which he had
long looked forward. At any rate, he did not
give up his ideals and he seems to have thought
that in the hour of victory he could do what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
had not been able to do in the hour of necessity.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Chaumont was followed by the
battle of Leipzig, and that was followed by several
smaller battles in which the allies fought
their way through French territory until they
stood before the gates of Paris in the autumn of
1814. Napoleon fled the Nemesis that had overtaken
him, the city was opened to his enemies,
and Alexander I, at the head of his splendid
guard, led the conquering army down the broad
avenue of Champs Elysée, the inhabitants of the
city cheering the radiant pageant. Men reflected
that two years earlier a great French army had
penetrated to the Russian city of Moscow and
found it smoking ruins; and they could but
observe the contrast. It was worthy of the greatness
of the tsar of the Russias to show a generous
face to a beaten foe; and the Frenchmen
were gallant enough to receive the friendship of
the tsar in the spirit in which it was given. A
lenient treaty by which France was saved from
humiliation and Napoleon was given Elba, was
also due chiefly to the good will of Alexander.
An Englishman on the spot, who did not see
things with the broad vision of the prime minister,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
wrote that the tsar “by a series of firm
and glorious conduct has richly deserved the
appellation of the liberator of mankind.” But
as Alexander continued to “play the part
of Providence in France” the same writer became
alarmed and five days later wrote to London
urging that Castlereagh come to the French
capital. The hint was taken, and soon the manly
stride of the handsome tsar was intercepted by
the deftly woven webs of the skilled diplomat.
Erelong France was handed over to the Bourbons,
who came back to show that they had
learned nothing and forgotten nothing.</p>

<p>The center of interest now shifted to the Congress
of Vienna, whose sessions lasted from
September 10, 1814, to June 9, 1815. Europe
had looked forward to it for many years as the
means of effecting a wise and just reform in
all the evils that afflicted the continent. “Men
had promised themselves,” said Gentz, “an all-embracing
reform of the political system of
Europe, guarantees for universal peace, in one
word, the return of the golden age.” Thus
Alexander was not entirely ahead of his time.
There were enlightened men then, as now, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
hoped for a spirit that would rise above mere
diplomatic self-interest; and we may look upon
the tsar as their exponent. But they were to be
disappointed. Spoils were to be divided and in
the disputes that the expected division engendered,
the spirit of reform was dissipated.
Alexander spent his energy in trying to reëstablish
the kingdom of Poland with liberal institutions,
but his desire that it should be under his
protection aroused the keenest opposition from
the neighboring nations. If a victorious Russia
stood as protector of a reëstablished France and
a renewed Poland, who could foretell her power
in future dealings among nations? Considering
the extent to which jealousy carried the contentions
of the states at Vienna, it is enough that
the congress did not break up in an appeal to
arms.</p>

<p>Gentz, whom we recall as the secretary of the
congress, was one of the men who had entertained
hopes that it would give a new and better form to
the political structure of Europe. He avowed
his disappointment at the results in saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Congress has resulted in nothing but restorations,
which had already been effected by arms, agreements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span> between
the Great Powers of little value for the future
balance and preservation of the peace of Europe, quite arbitrary
alterations in the possessions of the smaller states;
but no act of a higher nature, no great measure for public
order or for the general good, which might compensate
humanity for its long sufferings or pacify it for the future....
But to be just, the treaty, such as it is, has the undeniable
merit of having prepared the world for a more
complete political structure. If ever the Powers should
meet again to establish a political system by which wars
of conquest would be rendered impossible, and the rights
of all guaranteed, the Congress of Vienna, as a preparatory
assembly, will not have been without use. A number of
vexatious details have been settled, and the ground has been
prepared for building up a better social structure.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> See Phillips, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">loc. cit.</i>, 118.</p></div>

<p>Looking back over the past century it is hard
to find justification for Gentz’s optimism. The
respite that Europe had for a generation from
war was due in a sense to the lesson learned
in the Napoleonic struggle; but it was not a
permanent lesson. We shall proceed to examine
the expedients that came to be used for the end
specified; but it is certain that they did not
achieve permanently the end desired. Had the
Congress of Vienna done all that was expected
of it, the world might today be at peace. If not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
at peace, we might at least say that the men of
the Congress did all they could to secure peace.</p>

<p>If we ask for the fundamental cause of the
failure of the Congress of Vienna to satisfy the
hopes of liberal men in constructing what Gentz
called “a more complete political structure,” the
answer must lie in the illiberal views of the ruling
classes in the European states. Self-government
was less developed than in the most conservative
state of today. Had the people of these
states been in power, and had they been to a fair
degree trained in the principles of good government,
the result could hardly have been as it was.
But the ignorant bureaucrats and arbitrary
rulers were in power, men who in their own lives
never knew the burdens of war, and to whom
national egotism appeared a high virtue; and
they thought only of gaining territory for
their states. They placed such things above the
high opportunity to reform the political structure
of Europe. They turned to the future with the
old principles still dominant, hoping that by a
system of concert among the great states they
could stave off war for an indefinitely long period.
They could place self-interest against self-interest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
forgetting that a time was likely to come
when self-interest might lead the strongest to
dare the rest of the world, hoping to move quickly
in a moment of temporary advantage and thus
gain ends that only the most severe sacrifices
could take away. But that is a story reserved
for another chapter.</p>

<p>Before we take up the Concert of Europe we
must deal with the Holy Alliance, which, though
but an interlude in the play, is so frequently mentioned
in the books that it cannot be omitted
from this discussion. It was signed at Paris,
November 20, 1815, and may be considered only
one of the forms in which the tsar’s ideal was
embodied. Its religious character made it the
butt of ridicule for the “practical” statesmen
of the day, and the historian has been prone to
look at it from their standpoint. But it was then
popular to express political principles in religious
phrases, and the alliance is to be interpreted
by the purpose that lay underneath, rather
than by the mere form in which it was set forth.</p>

<p>As we have seen, Alexander I had formulated
his plan for a league of states long before the end
of the war. He had relaxed his intentions in no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
sense when he met Baroness Krüdener in June,
1815. This remarkable woman, though nobly
born, was a religious enthusiast who to the faculty
of intense conviction added the gift of preaching.
Wherever she went she found followers who hung
on her words and yielded themselves to her impassioned
appeals for religious devotion. In the
height of her enthusiasm she came to think that
she had revelations from God. Many a popular
revivalist of recent times could be compared with
her; and if we are tolerant of their undoubtedly
well-meant efforts to stir humanity to righteousness,
we may allow her also a fair share of our
esteem as a would-be agent of good through the
employment of human means to attain human
ends.</p>

<p>Like the other religious teachers of the day
she was deeply impressed by the calamities of the
war. She knew of the tsar’s desire to establish
a régime of peace and came to believe she was
divinely called to induce him to take a conspicuous
step in that direction. At first Alexander,
who was not always religious, refused to see her;
but in June, 1815, an interview was arranged
while he was at Heilbron, on the campaign. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
was deeply impressed and asked her to remain
near him. When he went to Paris after the
second defeat of Napoleon she was given quarters
near his palace, and it was there, in the following
autumn, that he drew up the plan of the Holy
Alliance.</p>

<p>The “Alliance” was expressed in the spirit of
a mediæval religious brotherhood. The signatory
sovereigns pledged themselves to take the
will of God for highest law, to give aid to an imperiled
brother sovereign, and to hold the Alliance
as “a true and indissoluble fraternity.” The
constituent states were to make “one great Christian
nation” and their sovereigns were to act
“as delegates of Providence” in ruling their respective
states. If such an ideal could have
been accomplished at all, a stronger grip of the
church on the springs of government would have
been necessary than existed in that day. The
tsar proclaimed the Holy Alliance on November
26, 1815. It was signed by all the states of
Europe except Turkey, Great Britain, and the
Papal State. Great Britain’s refusal to sign
was due to Castlereagh, to whom the tsar seemed
mentally unbalanced. He gave as his justification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
that the prince-regent, ruling in the place of
his insane father, had no authority to sign, but
said that he would support the principles of the
Alliance. As it was to be a union of Christian
states the sultan was not invited to sign. The
Pope was not asked because of his overwhelming
influence in matters connected with religion.
Frederick William, of Prussia, was a religious
man and is believed to have signed in good faith.
Metternich advised the emperor of Austria to
sign but said that the document was mere verbiage.</p>

<p>In all I have said hitherto about the tsar’s idea
of preserving peace no definite plan has been
mentioned. His most specific utterance was to
ask for a league of nations, but he said nothing
of its powers, its specific organization, or the
limits of its action. The suggestion was vague,
probably because the mind of its author was itself
vague. If taken seriously it could be made to
serve as the foundation of a unified state of
Europe which might hold all other states under
its hand, a unified state largely under the domination
of Russia. That its author had no such
object in view is not to be doubted for an instant;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
but who could tell how long he would
remain in his existing state of mind, and how
soon he might be succeeded by a tsar of far other
spirit? As a plan for permanent peace the Holy
Alliance was impossible, not only because it was
cast in religious forms and thrown to a world in
which the authority of religion had lost much of
its ancient hold on the minds of men of influence,
but because its indefinite form made it a possible
instrument of greater evils than war.</p>

<p>Beneath its defects, however, was the great
idea of a unified Europe, in which justice has the
place of suspicion and intrigue, in which runs one
law, one order, and one obedience to the majesty
of the state. Alexander not only believed in such
an ideal, but he was willing to cast his nation into
the melting-pot in order to fuse such a state. He
could have given no better proof of his support of
his ideal. Of course, it was ahead of the time,
how much so it is hard to say. The widespread
popular longing for permanent peace would have
gone far in accepting unification of the states,
and in this sphere of opinion the religious cast
of the scheme was not a great disadvantage. The
thing which stood firmly in its way was the dull<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
practicality of the upper, ruling class. If it
could have passed these lions in the way, it might
have had a chance of working its way forward
into some acceptable form of a league in perpetuity.
But it is a big <em>if</em> that I have used.
Upper ruling classes know more about government
than the lower classes, and that is a source
of conservatism. The lower classes, knowing
little, usually act upon their impulses; the members
of the upper, ruling class, having information
in varying degrees, usually strike an average
of mediocre enlightenment, and it is a difficult
thing for a new idea to gain possession of them.
In 1815 the upper, ruling class was well settled
in power in Europe, and it was most convinced
of its superior wisdom. It never accepted the
tsar’s plan; and failing to get its acceptance the
plan was futile.</p>

<span class="subhead">EUROPE UNDER THE CONCERT OF THE POWERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Having disposed of Alexander’s plan for a
federation of nations it now remains to consider
the other plan which, under the name of “Concert
of Europe,” was adopted by Castlereagh and
Metternich, though not for the same purpose as
that which had inspired the tsar. Its fundamental
idea had been in the positions taken by
Pitt and Castlereagh when replying to the tsar’s
proposals, but it found its official basis in a Treaty
of Alliance signed by Great Britain, Russia,
Austria, and Prussia at Paris, November 20,
1815, the same day they accepted the Holy
Alliance. Its chief provisions were as follows:
1. The Powers bound themselves to see that
the second treaty of Paris, regulating affairs between
France and the allies, was executed. 2.
They agreed to meet from time to time to take
cognizance of the state of affairs in Europe. 3.
They promised to suppress any recurrence of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
revolutionary activity of France. 4. They settled
upon the quota of men and supplies that each
nation should furnish in case common action became
necessary. 5. They undertook to “consolidate
the intimate tie which unites the four
sovereigns for the happiness of the world.” The
most important of these provisions for the purpose
of this inquiry was the second, taken in connection
with the fifth.</p>

<p>The first meeting that may be said to have been
called under the agreement was the Conference
of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1818. It was called to
determine whether or not France should be relieved
of her garrisons of occupation, a matter
which was soon adjusted. Alexander I saw
his opportunity and urged that the sovereigns
should take steps to make the Holy Alliance a
more vital kind of league. But Castlereagh interposed,
as in former meetings, and turned the
efforts of the tsar aside without arousing his displeasure.
This may be considered the last gasp
of the Holy Alliance, as it was the complete triumph
of the Concert over it. At the same time
France was admitted to the alliance of the four
powers, which henceforth was known as the Quintuple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Alliance. But if ever a question were
to come up in which France was at variance with
the four other Powers over matters connected
with her obligations assumed in recent treaties,
these four Powers would continue to act in their
old capacity. Mr. W.&nbsp;A. Phillips remarks that
the Quadruple Alliance still survived as “a rod
in pickle for a France but doubtfully disciplined.”
For us, who are chiefly concerned to see the result
of the attempt to take the affairs of Europe under
the protection of the great Powers, it is sufficient
to remember that France gave no further
trouble of the kind anticipated, and that the
Quintuple Alliance, as the formal expression of
the Concert of Europe, had other problems to
consider.</p>

<p>The first arose out of revolutions in Spain
and Naples, where armed men seized the power
and forced the kings to accept liberal constitutions.
Alexander I and Metternich looked on
with different feelings. The former had been
encouraging the liberals in Italy and was not
greatly shocked by the revolution there, but he
was deeply concerned over the upheaval in Spain
and would have led a Russian army thither to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
suppress it. The suggestion alarmed Metternich,
who did not relish the idea of Alexander’s
marching through Austrian lands with a great
body of men. He did what he could to discourage
the expedition against Spain. At the
same time he believed that Naples should be
disciplined, since its revolution endangered the
safety of Austrian possessions in Italy. It is
amusing to see how self-interest ran across the
currents of the general good as proclaimed in the
Concert of Europe.</p>

<p>The tsar thought the situation warranted calling
another conference of the Quintuple Alliance.
Metternich objected, being chiefly concerned by
the seeming certainty that the tsar would wish
to carry into the situation his well-known views
in support of liberalism. To him it seemed sufficient
that the powers should agree severally to
give their arms to the suppression of revolution,
without meeting in conference. After much
discussion a conference was called, at Troppau,
but it was regularly attended by only three of
the five powers. The suppression of constitutional
government was not popular in Great
Britain, and her government took no official part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
in the conference. France held aloof also; she
was so much under the protection of Great
Britain that she did not dare risk British displeasure
by allying herself with the forces of repression.</p>

<p>Did the absence of two nations from Troppau
presage the dissolution of the Alliance? Castlereagh
gave a negative reply. His nation, he said,
was not bound beyond her treaty obligations, the
terms of which were clear and specific. They
were embodied in the Treaties of Chaumont and
Paris. He considered the project of dealing with
revolution in its present form as beyond the meaning
of these agreements. “If,” he said, “it is desired
to extend the Alliance so as to include all
objects present and future, foreseen and unforeseen,
it would change its character to such an extent
and carry us so far, that we should see in it
an additional motive for adhering to our course at
the risk of seeing the Alliance move away from us
without our having quitted it.” These frank
words show that the Alliance was strained but
not broken. It would seem that a system like
that of which we speak should have at bottom
some broad common principles. In purpose it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
should be harmonious. As between the prevailing
British idea of liberty and Metternich’s ideas
of legitimacy there was no ground for mutual
support; and out of this divergence of views was
to grow the disruption of the Alliance, as we shall
soon see.</p>

<p>Up to this time the two ideas that had run side
by side were the tsar’s plan for a league to secure
coöperation of a general nature and the
British plan limiting common action to a few
specific matters, chiefly connected with the repression
of France in case she wished to return
to a policy which would threaten the peace of
Europe. As it became increasingly apparent
that France was no longer a menace this type of
union became less important, and the British
ardor for it cooled, especially since it was becoming
more and more certain that the Alliance was
being used to support repression.</p>

<p>At the same time a change was passing through
the mind of the tsar. In all he had done he had
been supported by liberal ministers, against whose
influence at his court Metternich did not hesitate
to intrigue. Alexander’s conversion to the cause
of repression came suddenly and completely in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
1820, when there was a mutiny in a favorite regiment
of his guard. Sober advisers pointed out
to him that the action of the regiment had no
political significance, but he would not be convinced.
He insisted he would not countenance
revolt abroad, lest it encourage insurrection at
home. All the fervor he had shown in behalf of
liberal ideas he now manifested in behalf of repression.
At Troppau he met Metternich in a
spirit of profound repentance for what he had
done in the past, saying with an outburst of
emotion: “So we are at one, Prince, and it is to
you that we owe it. You have correctly judged
the state of affairs. I deplore the waste of time,
which we must try to repair. I am here without
any fixed ideas; without any plan; but I bring
you a firm and unalterable resolution. It is for
your Emperor to use it as he wills. Tell me what
you desire, and what you wish me to do, and I
will do it.” The speech astonished the Prince
as much as it pleased him. All his schemes had
lost in the defection of Castlereagh, and probably
more, was made up in the accession of his new
ally. Not only was the cause of legitimacy, as
he advocated it, made safe; but the danger was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
removed of a Franco-Russian alliance, always
a thing to be dreaded by the great Powers in
the center of Europe.</p>

<p>In the conference at Troppau, Austria, Russia,
and Prussia now acted together. Up to that
time Metternich had ignored the Holy Alliance.
He now brought it out as his stalking horse.
The three sovereigns, controlling the conference,
issued a declaration suspending from the Alliance
any state that tolerated revolution in its borders
and declaring that the other Powers in the
Alliance would bring back the offending state by
force of arms. Under the indefinite terms of the
instrument this was a legal interpretation of
power, but it was not in the spirit of the benevolent
sovereign who made the Holy Alliance possible.</p>

<p>Those of us who now favor a league or federation
of states as a means of preserving peace
perpetually may well study the crisis to which a
similar system had come in the development of
international relations in 1820. The tsar’s ideal
was a thing of glory thrown before a sordid
world. Not even he, as we see, was proof against
the debasement of his surroundings. If his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
plan had been adopted by all the nations, it is
likely that the time would have come when
the confederation thus formed would have become
an agency for reaction against which liberal
views would have been unable to contend.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we must not ignore the
weight that a confederation would have had as
an idea in promoting respect for liberal government.
If it had been established under the protection
of the tsar, it may well have been that
Metternich would not have taken up the crusade
of legitimacy, that the tsar and Castlereagh
acting together in behalf of liberal institutions
would have insured a steadier attitude on the
part of the former, and that under such circumstances
the kings of Spain and Naples would
have been less inclined to the severe measures
which provoked revolution. Of course, these
are mere conjectures, but it is only fair to mention
them as things to be said for the other side
of the question.</p>

<p>When we come to apply the lessons of 1815&ndash;1820
to the present day, we must not forget that
conditions are now very greatly changed. It
was the supremacy of arbitrary government in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Europe that made the hopes of 1815 come to
naught. Of all the agents who then controlled
affairs in the great states of Europe, Castlereagh,
next to the tsar, was the most liberal. If a plan
of union were adopted after the present war, it
might not be a success, but the failure would not
be for the same reasons as those that brought
the Alliance of 1815 to a nullity.</p>

<p>Castlereagh made a protest against the purposes
of the three Powers at Troppau in which
were some telling arguments against such a
league as was threatening. They were well made
and would be applicable to the situation today,
if it were proposed to establish a league like that
which found favor at Troppau. The plan proposed,
said he, was too general in its scope. It
gave the projected confederation the right to
interfere in the internal affairs of independent
states on the ground that the general good was
concerned, and if carried out the Alliance would,
in effect, be charged with the function of policing
such states. Against all this he protested, and
he pointed out that so many grounds of dissatisfaction
lay in the scheme that to try to enforce
it would surely lead to counter alliances, the end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
of which would be war. It ought to be said, also,
that Castlereagh was opposed to giving up war
as a means of settling disputes. “The extreme
right of interference,” he said, “between nation
and nation can never be made a matter of written
stipulation or be assumed as the attribute of
an alliance.” If a man takes that position he
can hardly be expected to see good points in any
scheme to preserve peace perpetually.</p>

<p>The evils he pointed out are largely eliminated
in the modern plans that are offered. For example,
the jurisdiction of the proposed leagues
or federations is strictly limited to the enforcement
of peace. A supreme court held by eminent
judges would pass upon cases as they
come up and say whether or not the central authority
should employ force. Under the plan it
would be hard to bring a purely internal question
before the court, and if brought there it
would not be considered by the judges, since the
pact of the federation would specify that such
cases were not to be tried. The pact would be
the constitution of the federation, and the court
would be expected to pass on the constitutionality
of measures from the standpoint of that instrument.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Under a system like that recently advocated
a revolution in Naples would have to be
submitted to a court whose members were appointed
from states in which free institutions
are in existence. It could not be the tool of
a Metternich. Under such a system the whim of
a tsar, if such a ruler ever again wears a crown,
could not make or mar a question like that
which underlay the calling of the Conference of
Troppau. So many are the differences that it
is, perhaps, not profitable to dwell longer on
this point. The study of the peace problem and
the attempt to solve it a hundred years ago is
extremely interesting to one who considers the
situation now existing, but it is chiefly because
the mind, having grasped the development of the
former problem and become accustomed to see
the process as a whole, is in a better state to understand
the present and to know wherein it
differs from the past and in what respect old
factors are supplemented by new factors. Such
lessons from the past are open to all who will but
read.</p>

<p>These reflections should not make us forget the
main thread of our story, which became relatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
weak after Troppau. From that time it was
clear that Europe had no hopes of peace through
coöperation under either of the two plans that
had been suggested. Almost immediately began
a train of events which gave added impulse to the
dissolution of the Alliance. In 1821 began the
Greek War of Independence. Austria was in
consternation lest the revolution should spread
to her own people. Russia, however, was deeply
sympathetic with the Greeks, partly through
religious affiliations and partly because the Russian
people, looking toward the possession of
Constantinople, were anxious to weaken the
Turk in any of his European possessions.
Alexander I showed signs of going to war for
the Greeks, and Metternich hastily sought to
counteract any such course.</p>

<p>At the same time the situation in Spain’s
American colonies was becoming more urgent,
because the weakness of the government had
stimulated the South American revolutionists to
renewed activity until Mexico as well as the rest
of the Continental colonies except Peru was in
successful revolt. Metternich would have helped
Turkey against the Greeks and allowed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
tsar to carry out his long cherished wish of intervening
in Spain, as a means of keeping him quiet.
The situation seemed to call for another conference
and after some discussion a meeting was
arranged at Verona, 1822. France was anxious
to take over the task of punishing the Spanish
revolutionists, and as Russia, Austria, and Prussia
agreed to her plan, four of the five Great
Powers now stood side by side in favor of repression.
They would have gone further, and settled
the fate of the American revolutionists, but
against that course Great Britain made such a
protest that the question was left open.</p>

<p>It was not definitely closed until the next year,
and then through the action of the United States,
taken in association with Great Britain. For
when France had performed her task, she looked
forward to taking some of the Spanish colonies as
indemnity for her expenses. The principle of
federation among the Powers was working so well
that it was considered only a natural thing to
call another conference at which France could be
assigned the right of conquering the colonies.
Canning, at the head of the British government,
was genuinely alarmed. The four united Powers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
were willing to defy Great Britain if she stood
alone. He turned to the United States as the
only ally in sight. Would we support him in opposition
to the designs of the Powers? President
Monroe, influenced by John Quincy Adams’
stout patriotism, replied in the affirmative and
went a step further; for he insisted that the defiance
of the Powers should be announced in
Washington, not as a mere expedient to meet an
isolated case, but as a general policy of our government.
The Monroe Doctrine was one of the
things that broke up the Quintuple Alliance,
already weakened by the alienation of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>The last blow was the revolution in France
in 1880, which drove the Bourbon king into exile
and made a liberal government possible. At the
same time so strong were the manifestations of
republicanism in other countries that the old conservatism
was lowered in tone and chastened in
pride. From France the revolutionary movement
passed into Belgium, which the Congress of
Vienna had decreed should be a part of the kingdom
of the Netherlands. So completely was the
revolution successful that even the Great Powers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
had to bow to it, and in a congress at London
they recognized Belgium as a separate state and
saw it set up a liberal constitution with a king at
the head of the government. Several of the
small German governments also adopted more
liberal forms. Poland broke into rebellion and
before its power of resistance was crushed by
Russia the infection spread into Lithuania and
Podolia. At last the arms of the tsar overpowered
all resistance and peace reigned; but the
reactionaries were sobered, and the dream of a
league to enforce repression passed away.</p>

<p>Glancing backward we may see through what
a development the ideas of reform had passed.
Europe, distressed by the wars of 1800&ndash;1815,
had hungered for peace. Having issued from a
decade of discussion of liberty and humanity, the
friends of freedom were more than ordinarily
earnest for replacing war by an age of reason.
In our own day the cause of universal peace
stands on a broader and better laid foundation
than a hundred years ago, but it is, perhaps, no
more impressive. At any rate the philosophically
inclined men of the earlier period supported Kant
and Rousseau, among them, Alexander I. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
considerable portion of the world believed that
the outcome of the war madness then reigning
must be an era of sanity.</p>

<p>We have seen that two plans of improvement
were formed in the minds of men who were in
position to have practical influence: the tsar’s
scheme for a league, or federation, that was so
strongly integrated that the central authority
should be able to enforce its commands upon constituent
states; and the plan of Castlereagh for
prolonging the existing system of coöperation in
a form which we may call the Concert of the
Great Powers. We have seen that the tsar’s
plan, ignored at first, was seized on by Metternich
as a possibility for enforcing a system of reaction,
that it met the opposition of Great Britain
and aroused the revolutionary protest of
1830, and thus it came to an end. It was never
the dream of any of the philosophers that a federation
should be formed which might become an
engine of despotism, yet practical use showed
that such a course was within the bounds of possibility.
The mere glimpse of such a thing was
enough to make Europe prefer the old era of
wars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
One does not have to look far into the situation
to see that the real failure of the plan was due
to the wide use of arbitrary government in Europe.
Had Austria, Russia, and Prussia been
ruled by the people, either as republics or as liberal
monarchies, the great alliance of Europe
could hardly have been turned to the side of repression;
and under the guidance of enlightened
statesmen it might have been the beginning of a
long era of peace and international good will.
The failure of the nineteenth century, therefore,
does not prove that federation is essentially impossible.
It only proves that a century ago the
world was not ready to employ it successfully.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LATER PHASES OF THE CONCERT OF EUROPE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The revolutionary movement of 1830 did not
destroy the influence of Metternich in Europe.
He was too able a man to be overthrown as leader
of the legitimists merely because the people were
in a ferment. To his party he was still the man
to be trusted, and as legitimacy managed to beat
down revolution in most of the areas in which
commotion appeared, the scope of his power was
wide, although it was evident that he could not
use it with former impunity.</p>

<p>At the same time he gave up the pretense of
making the Alliance of the Powers a federation.
He was content to try to secure that concert of
action that would enable the states that leaned
to legitimacy to act together against incipient
revolution; and for a time he was successful.
In anticipation of the failure of the plan to permit
France to interfere in the Spanish colonies,
Canning exclaimed: “Things are getting back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
to a wholesome state again. Every nation for
itself and God for us all!” But the cry of joy
was premature. The time had not returned in
which each crisis was to be met in its own way,
without reference to a recognized concert of action,
and the reason was the deep consciousness
of the states that certain grave questions that
ever hung over the horizon had in them the possibilities
of general war. Let one of these questions
loom large, and common action was taken
to avert the threatened danger. In such way the
Concert of Europe was kept alive, and remained
something to be reckoned with as a part of the
background of European policy. In spite of
its temporary disuse, it was a thing to be brought
forth again if the nations decided that it was
needed to meet an emergency.</p>

<p>In fact, it reappeared many times in the course
of the nineteenth century, notably in 1840, when
the so-called Eastern question became prominent.
At that time Mehemet Ali, who had made
himself lord of Egypt and seized Syria, was
threatening Constantinople, having the support
of France. Russia became alarmed, made a
close alliance with the sultan, and seemed about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
to get that secure foothold on the Bosphorus for
which she had striven many years. Great Britain,
Austria, and Prussia resented this prospect
and took steps jointly to counteract it. Their
object was to preserve Turkey from the dangers
that threatened to divide her. Before such a
combination Russia was not able to stand, and
she gave up her pretensions in order to join the
other three powers. France, however, held to
her purpose, supporting the adventurer of
Egypt. Thus it happened that the four Great
Powers, reviving the Concert of Europe, but
leaving out the government of Louis Philippe,
had a conference in London to settle Eastern
affairs. They decided to offer Mehemet Ali certain
concessions and to make war on him if he
refused to accept them. He spurned their counsel
and was expelled from Syria but was saved
from utter destruction by the interference of
France, who secured a settlement by which he
was left in firm possession of Egypt, as hereditary
ruler under the nominal authority of Turkey.
All the powers now united in an agreement
by which Turkey was to exclude foreign
warships from the Dardanelles. Thus, by an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
appeal to the principle of the Concert of Europe,
a grave crisis was averted, and war between
Great Britain and Russia was avoided.</p>

<p>In 1848, seven years after the conclusion of
these negotiations, Europe was thrown into convulsions
by the appearance of a new era of
revolution. France became a republic, and Germany,
Austria, and Hungary went through such
violent upheavals that the existence of arbitrary
government hung for a time in the balance. Out
of the struggle emerged Napoleon III, of
France, who thought some military achievement
was necessary to stabilize his power. At that
time Russia was asserting a protectorate over all
Christians in Turkey, and it was generally believed
that she was about to establish vital political
control. Napoleon took up the sword against
her and Great Britain came to help, the result
being the Crimean War, 1854&ndash;1856.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this struggle the Concert
of Europe seemed to be dead, but two years of
heavy fighting and nearly futile losses brought it
to life again. The war, which began in an outburst
of international rivalry, ended in the Conference
of Paris, 1856, in which all the Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Powers but Prussia undertook to settle the
Eastern question by neutralizing the Euxine and
the Danube and by making new allotments of
territory which were supposed to adjust boundaries
in such a manner that rivalries would disappear.
The Conference went on to take up the
work of a true European congress by agreeing
upon the Declaration of Paris, in which were
assembled a body of rules regulating neutral
trade in time of war. England gave up her long
defended pretension to seize enemy goods on
neutral ships and neutral goods on enemy ships,
and in return gained the recognition that privateering
was unlawful. Thus the Crimean War,
fought by Great Britain and France against
Russia, and in support of Turkey&mdash;with Austria
and Prussia as neutrals&mdash;was at last ended by
an agreement between all the parties concerned.
The nations undertook to settle the long Eastern
dispute by pledging the sultan to reforms which
it was not in his nature to carry out.</p>

<p>The next three wars were fought without
respect to the Concert of Europe. They arose
from local causes and were soon determined without
the aid of the Great Powers. They were the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
war of Austria and France over the liberation of
Italy, 1859; the war between Prussia and Austria,
1866, in which Prussia overthrew the Austrian
predominancy in Germany; and the Franco-Prussian
war in 1870&ndash;1871, in which Prussia
crushed France and made herself the head of the
German Empire. In the first of these struggles
no state could gain enough power to become a
menace to the other states, since Italy was to be
the recipient of all territory gained. Had the
contest gone so far as to promise the vast enlargement
of the power of France by reason of
an alliance with enlarged Italy, interference
might have resulted. In fact, the German states
began to suspect such a result, and the realization
of it was one of Napoleon’s reasons for withdrawing
very unceremoniously from the war.
Here we see, therefore, that the principle of concert
was not entirely dead. The second and third
wars were fought by a brilliantly organized state,
Prussia, with whose successful armies no nation
cared to make a trial of strength.</p>

<p>In 1877 Russia made war on Turkey and proceeded
with such energy that she soon forced
the sultan to sign the treaty of San Stefano, altogether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
in favor of Russia. The particulars
of the struggle belong to another chapter,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> but
here it is only necessary to point out that the
Concert of Europe was now suddenly revived by
the Great Powers, and Russia was forced to submit
her well won victory to the Congress of Berlin,
which scaled down the awards of San Stefano
until Russia might well ask what was left of her
victory. A similar thing happened in the Balkan
War of 1912&ndash;1913. Here the parties concerned
had fought their quarrel out to the end
and had nearly expelled Turkey from Europe,
dividing the spoils among themselves. Then
in stepped the Great Powers, prescribing in a
treaty at London the limits of gain to the successful
contestants. They acted in the interest
of peace; for Austria, watching the actions of Serbia
and Greece, let it be known that she would
not allow Serbia to have Albania, and the Powers
interfered in order to prevent such action from
kindling a great European war.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> See below, p. <a href="#Page_112">112</a>.</p></div>

<p>Thus in three notable wars, the Crimean War,
the Russo-Turkish War, and the Balkan War,
the action of the Great Powers was not to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
war, but to neutralize its gains. So far did
this principle go that writers were known to suggest
that war would no longer be profitable to
nations, since in a Concert of Europe the Great
Powers would ever nullify the gains of the contestants.</p>

<p>At this time concert had come to mean another
thing than it meant in the decade after the fall
of Napoleon. Then it was a fixed system of consultation
and decision in anticipation of some
issue that threatened war: now it was concerted
action to keep a local war from going so far
as to involve a general conflict. It was a
last resort in the presence of dire danger. A
more present means of preserving peace was the
Balance of Power, which consisted in forming
the states in groups one of which balanced another
group and prevented the development of
overwhelming strength. The principle was well
known in the past history of Europe, but it was
never so clearly defined in the remote past as in
the last half century. For our purposes its
modern phase begins after the Franco-Prussian
War, 1870&ndash;1871.</p>

<p>Before that time Prussia was strong in Europe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
but not over-whelmingly great. On one side
was Austria, long her enemy, and on the other
was France. Within five years they were defeated
with such quick and crushing blows that
the world was startled and the Germans themselves
were as much astonished as delighted.
Out of this brilliant period of success arose the
German Empire, with Prussia for its corner-stone
and Bismarck for its builder and guardian.
Immediately a singular thing happened. One
would hardly expect that a beaten state would
straightway form an alliance with the power that
had humiliated her; yet such a relation was established
between Germany and Austria, and it
has lasted to this day. Where Germany has
loved Austria has loved, where Germany has
hated Austria has hated, and the ambition of
one has been supported by the other. Bismarck’s
policy had this state of friendship in view
and he gave Austria generous terms of peace in
1866, when she was at his feet. Common blood
bound the two states together and later led to
the hope of unification in a great Pan-German
empire.</p>

<p>With France, however, the empire which Bismarck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
founded was to have no such state of
amity. Between them was no brotherhood, not
even in the tenuous bonds of the theory of the
rights of man. Back of 1871 were many acts
of aggression, many bitter wars, and some very
humiliating experiences for states inhabited by
Germans. And now the tables were turned.
France was weak and the often beaten Germans
were strong and victorious. Their vengeance
was expressed in the long siege of Paris, the
proclamation of the German Empire in the
château of the old French kings, the humiliating
indemnity levied on the French people, and the
annexation of Alsace and Lorraine, so long in
the quiet keeping of France that they were thoroughly
French in sympathy and political purpose.
Bismarck usually ruled his heart with his
head, but he lost himself for the moment when
he sent a defeated neighbor under the yoke of
needless disgrace, and Germany has paid the
price many times over in maintaining a great
army and parrying the diplomatic thrusts of
France. The hostile feelings thus engendered
gave rise to the particular kind of balance of
power that has existed in Europe since 1871;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
for on whatever side Germany was found France
was on the other, and however the elements
shifted in the grouping of nations these two states
were always opponents.</p>

<p>It was Bismarck’s idea to form an alliance so
powerful that no other state nor group of states
would dare attack it, and by holding his allies
in hand to preserve peace. That was the way
the Balance of Power was to serve to prevent
war. For his purpose he formed what was
known as the Three Emperors’ League, consisting
of the rulers of Germany, Russia, and Austria.
The combination was weak in one important
point; for Russia and Austria had rival
hopes of territorial gains in the Near East, and
they were not likely to remain permanently in
accord. With an eye to such a disruption of the
alliance Bismarck looked about for another state
which could be added to the group. He turned
to Italy, bound to him because he had befriended
her in her struggle for nationality.</p>

<p>To bring Italy into the alliance was not easy;
for she was bitterly hostile to Austria, who still
held the unredeemed part of the Italian people
and who was still hated in the peninsula for her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
ancient oppression of Italian provinces. The
Iron Chancellor generally carried his point,
partly because of his personal ability and partly
because it was felt that he could and would live
up to his promises. He showed the king of Italy
the advantages the kingdom would have under
German protection, which would support it
against France, strengthen it in the quarrel with
the pope, and even hold back Austria if that
power was inclined to pay off old scores. These
arrangements were completed in 1882 and gave
rise to the Triple Alliance, until 1914 a strong
factor in European affairs. The greatness of
Bismarck is well shown in the fact that he could
carry this plan through and still retain Russia
in coöperation with Austria and Germany.
Until he retired from office in 1890 he had the
support of the tsar.</p>

<p>After he withdrew the union of the three emperors
was dissolved. But for his strong hand
it could hardly have been formed. Russia and
Austria were at bottom rivals. If Germany
supported Russia in her plans for the Near East
she would offend Austria, and if she lent herself
to Austria she would lose Russia. Moreover, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
she favored Russia openly she was likely to
arouse the opposition of Great Britain, who was
at that time very suspicious of the tsar’s designs
on Constantinople. It was a delicate situation,
and it was only good luck and Bismarck’s character
that kept it intact for more than fifteen
years.</p>

<p>After 1890 the Triple Alliance continued its
existence, Italy suppressing her dislike for
Austria as well as she could in view of her need
of strong friends among the nations. But Russia
fell away and in 1895 announced that she had
formed a Dual Alliance with France, a thing
which Bismarck had been very solicitous to
prevent. By holding Russia in hand he had been
able to isolate France in Europe, but her isolation
was now a thing of the past. The Dual
Alliance confronted the Triple Alliance and the
result was peace. At the same time the rivalry
of Russia and Austria over Turkey became more
energetic, which tended to increase the probability
of war.</p>

<p>Succeeding Bismarck came German statesmen
who were not so steady as he, and their
weaker hold on the situation added to the gravity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
of the prospects of peace. It can hardly be
doubted that the fall of Bismarck lessened the
prospect that Europe would remain at peace.
The Balance of Power, which took so clear a
form with the organization of the Dual Alliance,
was not as good a guarantee of peace as it seemed;
for while it made the checking of powers by
powers more apparent, its very existence was
evidence of a state of stronger rivalry of nations
than existed before the Dual Alliance was
formed. At the same time the men who now
guided the fortunes of Germany were not so convinced
as Bismarck that the country should have
peace.</p>

<p>While these things happened Great Britain remained
generally neutral. She was busy with
trade expansion and the development of her
colonies, especially in Africa; and her chief interest,
so far as the schemes of the Continental
nations were concerned, was to see that none of
them interfered with her progress in that field
of endeavor. Late in Bismarck’s time, however,
she became convinced that Germany was becoming
a rival both in trade and colonization. It is
true that France was also a rival, and between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
her and Great Britain occurred some sharp passages;
but France was not an aggressive nation
and had no strong military resources to back her
ambitions in the field of peaceful activities. Germany,
on the other hand, was increasingly militaristic
and the logic of events seemed to indicate
that she would at some time in the future be
willing to support her commercial and colonial
ambition with a formidable appeal to arms.
British anxiety was quickened when the young
kaiser began to build a great navy, with the
avowed object of making it equal to the British
navy. For centuries it had been the key-note
of British policy to have a navy that could control
the seas; and while there was nothing in the
will of Father Adam that gave Britons the dominion
of the seas, the kaiser must have known
that he could not challenge their superiority on
water without arousing their gravest apprehension.
During the Boer war (1899&ndash;1902)
Germany gave added offense to Britain. She
showed sympathy openly for the Boers, and it
was generally believed in Great Britain that she
took advantage of the opportunity to try to form
a grand alliance to curb the power of the “Mistress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
of the Seas.” Rumor said that the plan
was defeated only by the refusal of France to
lend her assistance unless she received Alsace-Lorraine.
If the report is true, it only shows
what a costly thing to Germany was the hatred
that Bismarck created when he put France to
the humiliating dismemberment of 1871.</p>

<p>During this period Théophile Delcassé was
head of the French foreign office (1898&ndash;1905).
He was a man of great original ability and was
desirous of restoring the prestige of France.
When he came into office the French public was
excited over the Fashoda incident, a clash of
French and British interests in the Sudan which
seemed to threaten war. The British government
took a strong attitude, as it was likely at
that time to do, when it felt that it was dealing
with a weaker nation. Delcassé realized that
the true welfare of his country demanded friendship
with the one power which could help it
against Germany, and at the risk of denunciation
at home he gave up all that Great Britain demanded
in the Sudan. He thus showed that
he possessed that high trait of statesmanship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
which consists in the ability to convert an opponent
into a firm friend.</p>

<p>The opportunity to which he was looking forward
came when Germany set her plans into
operation during the Boer war. He not only
held out for the return of the lost provinces but,
that failing, made overtures for a better understanding
with the British. It was a time when
a friendly hand was gladly received by the London
government. The result was a series of
agreements which became known as the <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente
Cordiale</cite>, 1904. They marked the reappearance
of Great Britain as a leading power in Continental
affairs, after a long period of aloofness.
She had become an active part of the Balance
of Power, and her strength was thrown to the
side which was bent on restraining the vast influence
of Germany. Her action caused great
alarm at Berlin, where her motive was interpreted
as commercial jealousy, the statesmen of
that city apparently forgetting that they had provoked
it by their unfriendly attitude in the Boer
war.</p>

<p>In the same year began the Russo-Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
war (1904&ndash;1905). At first glance it would seem
that this conflict threatened to weaken the <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente
Cordiale</cite>, for Japan was allied to Great
Britain and Russia was bound up with France
by the Dual Alliance. But the result was just
the opposite. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> was not only left intact,
but it was actually strengthened. When
Japan defeated Russia, Great Britain ceased to
fear Russian aggression in the Far East, which
made it possible for her to draw nearer to the
Muscovite power. At the same time, Russia,
always seeking an outlet to the sea, turned her
eyes with greater eagerness than ever to the
Near East, which brought her into a more intense
state of opposition to Austria and Germany.
Delcassé seized the opportunity offered him and
succeeded in bringing together these two great
nations, which for many years had been continually
ready to fly at one another. He put
into motion the negotiations out of which was
formed the Triple <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> (1907) in which
Great Britain, France, and Russia announced
that they had settled their differences and would
stand together in future crises.</p>

<p>The incidents that followed the culmination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
of Delcassé’s diplomacy are very striking, but
they must be deferred until I reach a later stage
of my subject. Here it is only proper to observe
that it brought the theory of the Balance of
Power to its logical development. Delcassé was
in a world in which one great and most efficiently
armed nation stood in a position to turn suddenly
on the rest of Europe and sweep it into
her lap. By her military and naval power, by
her vast trained army, by her readiness for instantaneous
action, by her well planned strategic
railroads, and by her alliances with the middle-European
states she was in a threatening position.
At a given signal she could seize great domains,
fortify herself, and defy all the world to drive
her out of what she had taken. There was hardly
an intelligent German who did not believe that
this course would be followed in the near future
and who did not feel confident that it would make
Germany the dominating nation of the world.
Against this system the Triple <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> was
formed, as a means of balance. It was larger
than the Triple Alliance but not so effectively
led.</p>

<p>And here I must observe that these two groups<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
had come into existence in the most natural way.
Bismarck had founded the Triple Alliance as a
means of preserving peace, not as a means of
aggression; but it had become something more
than he intended it to be. It had enabled Germany
to play such a part in European politics
that the creation of another great group as a
balance was apparently demanded. Immediately
that her position was lowered Germany
felt aggrieved that the combination had been
made against her. So powerful were her convictions
about her wrongs that she threw away
all thought of a concert of the Great Powers for
the settlement of the difficulty. She had trusted
to the Balance to protect her; but she now considered
it something more than a state of equilibrium
and she appealed to arms. Before this
narrative recounts the actual events by which
she felt that she was justified in taking this step,
it is necessary to consider the Balkan question, a
series of causes and events which for nearly a
century has been an open menace to European
peace and stability.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="subhead">THE BALKAN STATES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Viscount Grey has been criticized for not
understanding the Balkan problem. If his
critics understood how complex is the story of the
last century in this part of Europe they would
withold their strictures. I, at least, do not
blame any man for failing to carry in his mind
an appreciation of all that the mixed mass of
races and religions in the Balkan country have
striven and hoped for during the recent past. In
this chapter the best that can be promised is an
account of the main facts of Balkan history. A
more detailed narrative would be confusing to
the reader. A failure to mention the subject
would leave much unexplained that is essential to
an understanding of the origin of the present
war. And we shall hardly know how to decide
what kind of a peace the future security of
Europe demands, if we leave out of consideration
the proper disposition to be made of the small
states of the Southeast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
In 1453 Turkey took Constantinople and began
a series of conquests that carried her to the
very gates of the city of Vienna. That important
stronghold seemed about to fall into her
hands in 1683, when an army of Polish and German
soldiers came to its rescue in the name of
Christianity, drove off the infidels, and wrenched
Hungary out of their hands for the benefit of
the Austrian power. This struggle proved the
highwater mark of Turkish conquest in Europe.
From that time to this, wars of reconquest have
followed one another, the pagans always playing
a losing game. But for a long time all that part
of Southeastern Europe that could be reached
from the Black Sea was held by the Turks, the
part that was easily reached from Germany
was held by the Christians, and the part that lay
between, a broad belt of hilly country, was continually
in dispute. Across it armies fought
back and forth, each side winning and losing in
turn, but with the general result in favor of the
Christians, who slowly pushed back the frontier
of their enemies.</p>

<p>The region held by the Turks was tenacious of
its Christian faith and recognized the religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople,
who, Christian though he was, stood under the
control of the sultan. The inhabitants suffered
many hardships and were reduced to the condition
of serfs under Mohammedan masters. The
long bondage to their overlords had a peculiar
effect on their characters. They came to think it
right to use fraud, violence, and subterfuge
against their oppressors, and so they employed
religion and patriotism to defend the commission
of acts which in ordinary situations are considered
without the pale of civilized conduct. To
this day the Balkan states are not rid of their
heritage from these years of moral darkness.</p>

<p>The Balkan people, ruled long as Turkish
subjects, have gradually formed themselves into
five principal groups as follows: the Serbians,
dwelling in the interior of the country northwest
of Turkey proper and occupying much of the
hinterland lying east of the Adriatic; the Bulgars,
settled east of the Serbs and extending as
far as the shores of the Black Sea; the Wallachians
and Moldavians, who were of kindred stock
and became known as Rumanians because they
believed themselves the descendants of the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
of the ancient Roman colony of Dacia;
the Albanians living along the lower eastern
shores of the Adriatic; and the Montenegrins, of
the same race as the Serbians, who defended
themselves so well in their mountain strongholds
that they could say they had never been conquered
by the Turks. Many race elements
entered into these groups, but the Serbs and
Montenegrins were largely Slavic, while the
Bulgars were generally of a distinct race of
Asiatic origin, and the Rumanians were generally
Vlachs, a name given to the Latin speaking
population of the Eastern Roman Empire.
The Albanians seem to be of mixed stock, but
they have a strong sense of nationality. These
five groups correspond respectively to the five
civil divisions that have emerged from the Turkish
provinces, each playing its part in the modern
Balkan problem.</p>

<p>Montenegro aside, the first group to become a
state was Serbia, whose hardy mountain inhabitants
rose in revolt in 1804. A number of
brave leaders appeared and valley by valley the
Turks were forced out of the country. The
Serbs were practically independent for a time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
but the sultan did not acquiesce in their freedom,
and the constant preparedness that was necessary
to repel any attack he might launch was a source
of much expense and anxiety to the people.</p>

<p>In 1821 the Greeks, also under the domination
of Turkey, rose in revolt. Great sympathy was
aroused in the rest of Europe and in spite of
the disposition of the Great Powers to allow
Turkey a free hand to preserve her territory intact,
lest one of them gain over-balancing territory,
public opinion forced them to intervene.
The first to show sympathy was Russia, who had
an interest in making herself the protector of the
Christians in Turkey. The other powers resented
her assistance to the Greeks, and finally
Great Britain and France united in a project of
intervention, sending a joint fleet to the Mediterranean
which destroyed the Turkish fleet at
Navarino in 1827. The stubborn sultan remained
unyielding, and in 1828 Russia entered
the war openly, having come to an agreement
with the other Powers. She sent an army across
the border which carried all before it, and the
sultan was forced to make the treaty of Adrianople,
in which Turkey recognized the independence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
of Greece and acknowledged Serbia as an
autonomous state under Turkish suzerainty.
At the same time Wallachia and Moldavia, where
Rumans lived, were recognized as independent
under a Russian protectorate. Thus one sovereign
and three dependent but locally autonomous
states stood forth out of the confused
and misgoverned Christian area of Turkey in
Europe.</p>

<p>The rest of the region, occupied by Bulgars
and Albanians, with Bosnia and Herzegovina,
claimed by the Serbs as legitimate parts of their
national habitat, remained in an unredeemed condition
and were governed by agents appointed
by the sultan. Montenegro retained her position
of practical independence, which Turkey
had been forced to acknowledge in 1799. These
arrangements were confirmed in a more formal
treaty in 1832.</p>

<p>The successes of this period quickened the
spirit of nationality in the Balkans. Just as the
Greeks were swept by a wave of enthusiasm for
their classical culture and sought to revive the
language and ideals of the remote past, so the
Balkan peoples set out to revive their ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
culture, long obscured by the shadow of Turkish
masters. Serbs, Rumans, and Bulgars made
grammars of their own languages, gathered up
what was preserved of their ancient literatures
and traditions, taught their children to revere
the national heroes, and sought in many other
ways to stimulate the spirit of nationality. The
Slavic portion turned to Russia for support,
whom they called their “big brother,” while the
Rumans cultivated an appreciation of Italy and
France, whom they considered kindred descendants
of the ancient Romans. To their national
hopes in these things was added the desire for
religious independence. They disliked being under
the ecclesiastical authority of the Patriarch
of Constantinople, who was appointed by the sultan,
and looked forward to a time when they
might have exarchs of their own, with jurisdiction
not limited by the Patriarch.</p>

<p>In 1854 Russia was ready for another advance
in the region of the Balkans, hoping to gain at
last what Peter the Great had declared was essential
to her progress, a window looking out on
the Mediterranean. Great Britain and France
came to the help of the sultan and the Crimean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
War followed. After a hard struggle it ended
in Russia’s defeat, and at the Conference of
Paris, 1856, the affairs of the Balkans were again
up for settlement, but this time the victory leaned
to the side of the Turk, although it was modified
by the restraining hand of his two allies. The
purport of the treaty was to reduce the power
of Russia, and in doing so the aspirations of the
Balkans states were checked. The protectorate
the tsar had established over Wallachia and Moldavia
was destroyed, and Bulgars, who had
expected independence, remained under the rule
of the sultan, while Greece, who had desired a
large portion of Macedonia, was forced to continue
in her old boundaries. This crisis was not
the last in which the vexed Balkan question,
seemingly near solution, was made to give way
before the complicated problems of the general
European situation. Looking backward we may
well say that if Russia had secured her wish, expelled
the Turk from Constantinople and liberated
the Balkan states, the fortunes of France
would not have been lessened, and Great Britain,
safe through her supremacy at sea, would not
have lost any of the strength she had in India.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
At the same time the sore spot of European
relations would have been healed, and we should
probably have had no war in 1914.</p>

<p>Wallachia and Moldavia were of the same
stock and wished to unite as one kingdom. They
made their desires known in the negotiations
that resulted in the Treaty of Paris, but the
Powers did not mean to create a large state on
the borders of Russia which might prove a bulwark
of influence for the tsar, and accordingly
they denied the request. The two states found
a way to accomplish their desire, soon after the
conference at Paris adjourned. Meeting to
select rulers each chose Alexander John Cuza
simultaneously, and after hesitating two years
the Powers acknowledged him as king. Thus
was formed the united kingdom of Rumania;
and its formation illustrated a weak point in the
Concert of Europe. However much the Powers
might interfere to prevent the consummation of
an act they considered dangerous, they would
think twice before trying to punish a Balkan
state, since in doing so they might set off an
explosion in the very system they were working
to keep peaceful. Rumania understood this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
phase of the matter and took her chances. Her
firm course had its reward.</p>

<p>The influence of Great Britain was now paramount
at Constantinople. The sultan was satisfied
with his ally, since he knew that of all the
Powers he had least to fear from this state, which
had no territories in that part of the Mediterranean
and was committed to the preservation of
his rule as a means of keeping Russia away from
the Bosphorus. To justify herself for defending
the Turk, Great Britain gave the world assurances
that the sultan was about to become good.
Under her insistance a series of reforms was announced,
but they did not go far in the realization.
Some of the promises referred to the government
of the Balkans, but they were as fruitless
as the others. Meanwhile French and
British merchants found large profits in Turkish
trade.</p>

<p>The tsar was humiliated by his loss of influence
in the Southeast, and in 1877 he began another
war against Turkey. He thought the time
favorable for such action. Impeded for a while
at Plevna, in Bulgaria, he at last swept the enemy
before him and took Adrianople on January 16,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
1878. His successes created great enthusiasm
among the Serbs, Bulgars, and Rumans, who
flocked to his victorious standard. The panic-stricken
sultan sued for peace and at San Stefano
signed a treaty which granted all that was demanded
of him. Serbia, Montenegro, and
Rumania were recognized as completely independent,
Bulgaria as an autonomous tributary
province, and Bosnia and Herzegovina were assured
of important administrative reforms.
Russia was awarded some territory not strictly in
the Balkans, but her greatest gain was the prestige
she now had as liberator of Christian states.</p>

<p>The treaty of San Stefano alarmed Great
Britain and Austria, both of whom felt that they
had major interests at stake. They got a congress
of the Great Powers to meet at Berlin,
1878, which revised the treaty in what they were
pleased to call the interest of European peace.
Complete independence was announced for
Serbia, Rumania, and Montenegro, and the sultan
accepted the fact of their perfect sovereignty.
By the treaty of San Stefano Bulgaria was to
include Macedon and eastern Rumelia, making
one great buffer province between the Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
and the Christian states. The three parts were
now left distinct, Bulgaria proper being autonomous
but under Turkish suzerainty, and the
other two less independent.</p>

<p>To create a “Big Bulgaria” as a bulwark
against Turkey had been Russia’s chief hope in
the war. Her initial success awakened enthusiasm
in all the Balkan people, and the results
were expressed in the way in which they rallied
to her aid. At last, said the onlookers, an opportunity
had come to found a strong Balkan
confederacy which would play an important
part in the development of the Near East. The
hand of Russia seemed strong enough to hold
these nascent states to one policy, allay their incipient
jealousies, and bring them to a great common
ideal. If such a course could have been
adopted the future of Europe would have been
profoundly altered. It was defeated by that
Concert of Europe which was supposed to exist
in order that the world might be spared the burden
of war. It was really prevented through the
operation of the forces of national selfishness,
safely esconced in the system which we have
called the Concert of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
The ambition of Austria-Hungary played a
large part at the Congress of Berlin. This nation
had long looked upon the region that separated
her from the Adriatic as a sphere through
which she was justified in extending her power at
the expense of Turkey, and she now felt that
the time had come to realize her plans. If she
waited, Russia would acquire such an influence
as to forestall Austrian advancement. Her eyes
were fixed on Bosnia and Herzegovina, for some
time in revolt against Turkish misgovernment.
Her influence was such that the congress gave
her the right to occupy and administer the two
provinces under the reservation of sovereignty to
the sultan. The inhabitants, who were largely
Slavic, were forced to accept the decision, although
they did not relax their cherished hopes
of independence. They were pawns thrown to
Austria as a balance for the gains of Russia.
The transaction only whetted the Austrian appetite
for more and deepened the Serbian resentment
for Austria.</p>

<p>Great Britain had her advantage out of the
bargain also. She retained her position of paramount
friend at Constantinople, justifying herself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
with the assurance that the sultan would
carry out reforms in his empire. She seemed
to think that the “Sick Man of Europe” would
cure himself under her guidance and then defend
himself against states that tried to oust him from
his seat of power. To enable her to watch the
bedside of her patient from a convenient position,
as well as to safeguard the Suez Canal,
Great Britain was given the right to occupy and
administer the island of Cyprus under nominal
authority of Turkey. To be perfectly fair we
must admit that there is little moral difference
between her acquisition of Cyprus and Austria’s
gain in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and it is clear
that in this case the Concert of Europe was a
concert for the gain of selfish ends. It is also
worth while to note that two of the Great Powers
took no benefit from the agreement. France
was slowly recovering from the war of 1870&ndash;1871
and was in no condition to fight, although
in 1881 she established a protectorate over Tunis.
The German Empire, newly founded and not yet
fully adapted to the imperial system, was also in
no condition to undertake a stiff encounter.
There were many Germans who wished that their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
government should not allow the other states to
get large gains of territory while Germany got
nothing; but they yielded to Bismarck’s wise
policy which held that it was not yet time
for Germany to assume an aggressive position
in the world. The impatience of the German
patriots lost nothing through having to
wait.</p>

<p>No treaty ends the march of time, and the
Balkan situation continued to develop along the
old lines. In 1881 Greece acquired Thessaly in
accordance with a promise made to her at the
Congress of Berlin. In 1885 East Rumelia declared
herself united to Bulgaria, acting in defiance
of the will of the Congress of Berlin. The
Powers did not interfere for the same reason
that they did not act when Wallachia and Moldavia
united in 1862. To attempt to undo the
union would have precipitated a general war.
The Concert was stronger to prevent a given
action than to correct it after it was done.
Serbia, however, took the action of the two
provinces as a menace and declared war against
the new state of Bulgaria. She seemed about
to throw herself on her adversary when she suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
made peace, evidently feeling she was not
strong enough to carry on the war alone.</p>

<p>Thenceforth the Powers showed that they did
not mean to allow the Balkan states to profit
by seizing parts of the decaying Turkish Empire.
But for their restraint it seems that the
Turk would have been expelled from Europe
before the end of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Their intention was clearly manifested in regard
to the island of Crete, whose population
long suffered from Turkish oppression. In 1896
the island was in revolt and the sultan was forced
to promise reforms. The assurance proved
empty and in 1897 Greece interfered in behalf
of Crete. In the war that followed the Greeks
fought heroically but alone and were no match
for Turkey in operations on land. They made
peace without success, but through the instrumentality
of the Great Powers the sultan agreed
to allow Crete self-government under an elected
assembly. The powers let it be known that
they would not have the island annexed to Greece,
which they did not mean to make a preponderating
influence in the Balkans. Now appeared a
great Cretan leader, Eleutherios Venezelos,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
whom his admirers call the Cavour of Greece.
Under his influence the Cretan assembly voted the
union of the island with Greece in 1905, but again
the Powers interposed, insisting that the sovereignty
of the sultan should not be abrogated.
However, they permitted the Greek king to appoint
a representative to rule the island as a
Turkish fief, and Greek officers were allowed to
train the Cretan soldiers and police. At last
the Balkan war (1912&ndash;1913) brought the completion
of union, the Great Powers yielding their
assent.</p>

<p>The explanation of the conduct of the Powers
in this incident is to be found in the delicate
nature of the whole Balkan question. With
Austria and Russia keenly aroused and each of
the Balkan states anxiously looking for the
moment when the rest of the sultan’s territory in
Europe was to be divided between them, it was
evident that a little thing could precipitate a
serious conflict. It was in view of this phase of
the situation that the Balkans were called “the
tinder-box of Europe.”</p>

<p>It will be observed that while these things
happened the Balkan states were developing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
steadily in national resources and spirit. Greece,
Serbia, Bulgaria, and Rumania became vitally
organized powers, it became more and more evident
that they were no longer mere pawns in
the diplomatic game, and the time was fast approaching
when they would wish to take parts
on their own initiative. So assertive were they
becoming that it was certain that the time would
soon come when the Great Powers would tire of
the process of holding conferences to keep these
states out of trouble. It is not an easy task to
serve as custodian for a “tinder-box.”</p>

<p>A fair warning of this kind of danger occurred
in 1908. For twenty-three years Bulgaria
had remained undisturbed, giving herself
to a rapid process of educational and industrial
development, in both of which lines she had
come under the influence of German methods.
Suddenly she threw off her nominal Turkish
sovereignty and declared herself an entirely independent
state. At the same time, and
evidently by agreement with the German Empire,
Austria-Hungary announced that she would
hold Bosnia-Herzegovina as an integral part of
her empire, thus superseding the “occupation”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
that was authorized by the congress of Berlin, in
1878. Serbia took the matter as a great injury,
but she could do nothing alone. Her natural
ally was Russia, then recovering from the severe
losses of the war against Japan. Had the tsar
been ready for war it is doubtful if he would
have drawn the sword in this instance; for a
world war would have resulted, and the nations
were not yet ready to think of such an undertaking.
But Serbia nursed her wrongs and to
Russia the sense of her shame grew as she thought
how her weakness had been flaunted in the face
of the world. The day came when the fire could
no longer be smothered.</p>

<p>To understand Serbia’s feelings we must recall
the national ideal by which her hopes had
been formed for many years. Most of the
people of Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina,
Novi-Bazar, and the northwestern corner of
Macedonia were Serbs by blood. To unite them
into a great Serbia had long been spoken of in
Serbia as the “Great Idea.” When, therefore,
Austria took definite possession of Bosnia-Herzegovina
the “Great Idea” seemed defeated
forever. Rage and despair possessed the Serbs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
wherever they lived, patriotic societies voiced the
feeling of the people, and vengeance was plotted.
Probably it was the feeling that this wide-spread
hatred should be uprooted in the most thorough
manner that prompted Austria to make the heavy
conditions that were demanded as atonement for
the crime of Sarajevo.</p>

<p>After Austria took the fateful step of 1908
Turkey still held the territory just north of the
Bosphorus, organized as the province of
Adrianople. She also had in Europe the provinces
of Macedonia, Albania, and the sanjak
of Novi-Bazar. To drive her out of these possessions
was the object of the Balkan states. In
1911 Italy began a war against the sultan to
gain Tripoli. The Balkan States seeing their
enemy embarrassed, concluded that the hour of
fate had come. They formed the Balkan
League, made up of Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia,
and Montenegro, and made ready for war.
Their action alarmed the Great Powers, who
brought the Concert of Europe to bear against
the League. They gave the allies fair notice
that they would not permit them to take any of
the sultan’s territory in Europe, even though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
a war was won against him. The reply to this
threat shows how weak the Concert had become.
It was voiced by Montenegro, the smallest of
the states, whose king immediately declared war
and called on his allies to aid him in driving the
pagan out of Europe. The call was accepted
gladly and an ultimatum was sent to the sultan,
who, relying on the promise of the Powers, defied
his opponents.</p>

<p>In the war that followed Turkey was confronted
by a united army of nearly a million
men. It was impossible to withstand them and
in two months most of Macedonia was lost, Constantinople
was threatened, and Turkey asked
for an armistice. Negotiations began in London,
the Powers seemingly forgetting their empty
threat that they “would not permit at the end of
the conflict any modification of the territorial
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">status quo</i> in European Turkey.” The allies demanded
hard terms which seemed about to be
accepted by Turkey when by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup d’état</i> the
“Young Turks,” a patriotic party of reformers,
got possession of the government at Constantinople
and resumed the fighting. Although they
fought well, they could not withstand the large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
numbers that were against them. Janina fell to
the Greeks, Adrianople was taken by a Serbo-Bulgarian
force, and Scutari was taken by the
Montenegrins. The Turks now yielded definitely
and negotiations for peace were resumed.</p>

<p>Behind the diplomatic proceedings was the following
interesting situation: Austria-Hungary
was dismayed at the prospect of having a strong
and permanent league organized in the Balkans;
for it would probably make it impossible for her
to realize her desire to extend her territory in
that direction. She was especially unwilling to
allow Serbia and Montenegro to hold the conquered
shore of the Adriatic, since it was here
that she designed to gain additional outlets to
the seas. Italy at the same time was alarmed at
the extension of Serbian power, since she, also,
did not relish the prospect of having a strong
state on the eastern side of the sea. It was with
unexpected short-sightedness, however, that she
was willing to block Serbia in order to promote
the schemes of Austria, a far more formidable
rival in that quarter, if she were ever firmly established
there. Both states, therefore, appeared
at London to limit the expansion of Serbia, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Germany supported them, seemingly on the
principle that she was merely standing by the
members of the Triple Alliance. It has been
supposed that she expected that Ferdinand, heir-apparent
of Austria, when he came to rule, would
promote a vital union of the two great Mid-Continental
empires. If we accept this theory, we
must conclude that she had a still more vital reason
for wishing Austria to have a large Adriatic
coast-line, with important commercial harbors.</p>

<p>These considerations ran exactly counter to
Serbia’s hopes in Albania. She had already occupied
the Albanian port of Durazzo and expected
to make it the center of a fair commercial
life. When ordered to withdraw she did not dare
refuse; but it was a great humiliation to her to
cut off the possibility of her future growth. For
a second time Austria had given her a vital blow,
and there was another wrong to be remembered
by those Serbians who were inclined to remember.
By the decree of the Powers Albania was made
an autonomous state under Turkish suzerainty,
and later on a German prince was appointed to
rule it.</p>

<p>While these affairs were being discussed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Montenegro besieged Scutari, in northern Albania
and continued operation until the place
was taken, notwithstanding the purpose of the
Powers was well known. Her courageous conduct
won the admiration of lovers of brave men
everywhere. Eight days after the capture of
Scutari, Austria announced that she would enter
the war if the place was not evacuated, and Italy
and Germany declared they would support her.
Throughout all Slavic countries arose a cry of
indignation. In Russia especially it was loud
and bitter; and it seemed that a great war was
about to begin when King Nicholas, of Montenegro,
gave the world the assurance of peace by
withdrawing his army from Scutari.</p>

<p>Then came that unhappy turn of affairs by
which the Balkan League was dissolved and the
hope disappeared that a strong power would
arise which would take the Near East out of the
position of pawn for the greed of the Great
Powers. Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria had made
an ante-bellum agreement for the disposal of the
territory they would take from Turkey, and the
first was to have a large part of Albania. Denied
this region she asked her allies to make a new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
allotment. Bulgaria raised strong objection,
since the new demand, if granted, would mean
that her gains would be smaller than was first
agreed. Angry speeches led to war, and after
a sharp struggle Bulgaria was beaten and forced
to make peace without honor. While they were
locked in the conflict Turkey seized the opportunity
to recover Adrianople, and eventually held
it. It illustrates the sordid nature of some of
the Balkan states that Rumania entered this war
for purely predatory purposes. She had remained
neutral during the common effort to drive
the Turk out; but now that Bulgaria was marching
to sure defeat she came into the battle against
her, and at the end of the war she demanded and
was given a large part of Bulgarian territory.
The “July War,” as this stage of the Balkan conflict
is called, left the allies filled with bitter
hatred for one another, and Bulgaria, weakened
as she was, felt little inclined to lean on any of
her immediate neighbors. She was ripe for the
reception of Teutonic offers of friendship, and
the result was soon seen of all men.</p>

<p>I have thus followed the complex story of the
Balkan States to the year 1913. Through a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
century of war and intrigue Serbia, Bulgaria,
Rumania, Greece, and the small state of Montenegro
had emerged from the Christian lands over
which the Turks had ruled. Russia and Austria
had taken small portions of those lands and had
definite plans to secure influence over larger portions.
In the Balkans Russian prestige was
great, but if a state feared it she was apt to look
to Austria, or to Germany&mdash;which was the same
thing&mdash;as a means of balancing against Russia.
At the same time it was known that Russia was
planning to construct strategic lines of railroad
leading to the Black Sea along the western border
of her empire, and this was considered an
ominous sign for the future. Altogether, the
“tinder-box” was ready for ignition.</p>

<p>As to Turkey, her fortunes shrank steadily.
At the end of the Balkan War she retained only
1,900,000 subjects in Europe, inhabitants of the
district around Adrianople. She was becoming
a distinctly Asiatic power, and the sultan must
have felt that his hold on Constantinople was
precarious. At the same time, as we shall see
later on, Great Britain had secured a foothold
on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and Russia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
was extending her influence in Persia, two threats
from the eastward. Any far sighted Turk could
see that his country was in danger of being
crushed in a vise of foreign aggression. To
which of the great states should Turkey turn for
that protection which had long been her safety?
Not to Russia, whose ambition was for Constantinople
itself, nor to Great Britain, who
seemed to desire the Euphrates Valley, and who
was safely established in Egypt. In her extremity
she listened to the suggestions of German
wooers, who promised industrial development,
railroads, and financial aid. Here was
laid the foundation of Turko-German sympathy
which was to be very important in the Great
War.</p>

<p>After a calamity has occurred it is easy to
point out the course by which it might have been
avoided. It seems certain that if we stood again
where the world stood in 1914 we should not do
what we did in 1914. So we can see in what
respects the events of the Balkan history went
wrong. But the men who settled the crises of
the past were not able to see what we see. They
had the same blindness for the future that we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
have for that which lies before us now. They
fumbled their problems as most men fumble
problems, as we shall, perhaps, go on fumbling
until the end of time. It is asking much to expect
that statesmen shall be as wise as we who
review their deeds.</p>

<p>But there are great facts in history which it is
possible to know and use with profit. One of
them is the incompetency of the principle of the
Concert of Europe to deal with a situation like
that we have reviewed in the Balkans. Concert
predicates a group of satisfied great states, without
over-reaching ambitions, who are willing to
unite their efforts to restrain small states, or even
one large state, from a course which shall force
the rest of the world into conflict. When a
group of great states have united to carry out a
certain policy, and another tries to restrain the
first group, concert is in great danger of breaking
down. That was the situation in the Balkans.
These states were drawn into the whirl
of general European politics, and they intensified
its velocity at one particular corner, so that
what may be contemplated as a harmonious rotary
movement broke into a twisting tornado.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
If, when the present war is over, the nations of
the world undertake to go on under the old system,
trusting to concert as the means of avoiding
war, there is no reason to expect that the future
will be less turbulent than the past.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="subhead">GERMAN IDEALS AND ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When wars begin between nations we usually
see the leaders of thought on each side busy developing
distrust among their own citizens for
the people against whom they are fighting. In
accordance with this fact, the people of the
United States have read a great deal since August,
1914, to make them think very unkindly of
Germany.</p>

<p>This chapter is not a plea for the Germans,
and I agree that they did unnecessarily cruel and
impossible things in Belgium. It is not to be
denied that they played a most unwise part in
the war game, when they tried to steal a march
on France by invading through Belgium, a thing
they were pledged not to do. It pays to keep
faith; and when a nation does not keep faith
other nations have no recourse but to treat it as
if it were a pirate. If they do otherwise, the
whole game will become a pirate’s game, and
good faith will disappear from international relations.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
If Germany may violate Belgium at
will, why may she not violate Switzerland, Holland,
or any other state that stands in her way;
and who would not expect her to do it, if no
powers faced her that were willing and able to
dispute her will?</p>

<p>It is not improbable that German leaders understood
this as well as we who now pass it under
review. They must have made their calculations
on arousing the opposition of the world and proceeded
with the expectation that they would gain
so much by their sweep through forbidden Belgium
that they could defy the world. And if
things had gone well for them, the calculation
would have been well made. For if Germany
had carried France off her feet and placed her
in a position to offer no further menace during
the next ten years, and if she had dealt a similar
blow to Russia, what power could have checked
her in the future decade? By glancing at the
situation in Europe today we may see how an
intrenched Germany defies the united and unwhipped
world. How much more might she not
have had her way, if the thrust through Belgium
had succeeded!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Let us suppose that the game of bad faith had
proved successful as planned, what would have
been the result? Probably Great Britain would
have wakened slowly to her peril, but her position
was such that she could have done nothing.
Her fleet would have been useless against an
enemy that rules on land. Her army could not
have met the combined Teutonic armies, and she
would have had no allies. Meanwhile, Germany
and Austria at their leisure could have digested
the Balkans and drawing Turkey into their net
could have established a “Mittel-Europa” that
would have left the rest of the world at their
mercy. These were alluring stakes to play for,
and it is not hard to see how a nation whose leaders
have thrown aside the homely motto that
“Righteousness exalteth a nation” would be willing
to take a chance in order to obtain them.</p>

<p>When we think of such things as these we are
in danger of concluding that they represent the
real Germany. We look back to that Germany
of the past which we saw in our youth, whose
music we have heard all our lives, whose Goethe
we have read, whose scholarship we have built
upon, and whose toys have amused us and our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
children through many decades and ask ourselves
whether or not we were mistaken in our
ideas of Germany. Are there two Germanies,
and if so, which is the true Germany? Probably
the answer is that each is the real Germany manifesting
herself in different moods. Fundamentally
we have an intense and emotional people,
swayed in one instance by artistic emotions, in
another by the love of exact research for facts,
in another by the feeling of domesticity, and in
still another by the powerful impulse of a great
national egoism. They are a people who can
love much, hate much, play much, sacrifice much,
and serve well when called into service. In their
war-maddened mood they have stained a fair
reputation, and they are now trying to think that
the stain will not matter if they can only fight
through to victory. But nations are like men in
this that however successful one may become
personally he never gets to be so great that he
can afford to carry a tarnished reputation.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the Germany of old and see
if we cannot observe the process by which she
came to her present state of mind. While I
realize that it is absolutely necessary for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
world to crush her attempt to rule Europe, I
cannot find it in my heart to hate her. She has
risen to such a state of efficiency in social organization
and in the capacity to spread the light of
civilization that she commands respect from
thinking foes. It is the duty of the world to
chasten the spirit of arrogance out of her, but to
leave her sound and able to deal with the future
in that way in which she is so well fitted to play
a strong and beneficial part. If ever a great
people needed the discipline of disaster to teach
them that nations, like men, should do to others
as they wish others to do to them, that nation is
the Germany of today. To understand in what
way this splendid state has run away from its
past we shall have to glance at its history in the
recent past.</p>

<p>For a point of departure let us take the Seven
Years’ War. This struggle was the result of the
ambition of young Frederick, a strong and unethical
king of Prussia. When he came to the
throne he found that a parsimonious father had
left him a full treasury, an excellent army, and
a united kingdom, while fate had sent the neighboring
state Austria, a young woman for ruler<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
and an army that was not formidable. It was
a favorable opportunity to seize Silesia, which
Prussia considered necessary to her welfare, and
to which she had the flimsiest pretense of right.
The rapacity of Frederick, her king, cannot be
justified on moral grounds, and it threw Europe
into commotions for which nearly a quarter of
a century was needed for settlement. The last
phase of this quarter-of-a-century was the Seven
Years’ War, 1756&ndash;1763. By the time it began
Frederick of Prussia was looked upon by his
neighbors as a menace to Europe; and Austria,
France, and Russia united to crush him. He
had a friend in Great Britain, who was generally
found among the foes of France. In the
great war he waged through seven years he
fought off foes first on one side and then on the
other until the war ended at last with Prussia
still unconquered.</p>

<p>If hard and valiant fighting and solicitude for
the welfare of his country could redeem the error
of the invasion of Silesia the Seven Years’ War
would relieve Frederick, whom posterity calls
“Frederick the Great,” of all odium on account
of the thoughtless way in which he began his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
wars. Unlike the present kaiser, he began a
long reign rashly and ended it wisely. Administrative
reforms and a policy of peace with his
neighbors made his last years a period of happiness
for Prussia.</p>

<p>But Silesia fixed a firm hold on the Prussian
imagination. Long justified as an act necessary
to the safety of the Fatherland, and therefore
permissible, it has given sanction for the idea
that wrong may be done that good shall result,
if only the state is to be benefitted. It is a false
doctrine, and it can do nothing but lead to wars.
Nations are under the same obligations to do
right as individuals.</p>

<p>The next phase of German history which has
interest for us in connection with this study is
that which lies between the years 1806 and 1813.
It was a period of deep humiliation at the hands
of Napoleon. The small states were huddled together
in a Confederation which was, in fact, a
tool of the Emperor of France, and Prussia lay
like a trembling and crushed thing in his hand.
No living man who hates Germany for the deeds
of the present war could wish her a worse fate
than Napoleon inflicted on her after the battle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
of Jena in 1806. He insulted the king, burdened
the people with requisitions, and limited their
armies. It was the acme of national shame for
the nation that is now so strong.</p>

<p>The cause of these woes was the lack of organization,
and perhaps Napoleon did the nation a
service when he beat the Prussians into a realization
of it. No nation is so poor that it has not
reformers who see in what way its evils may be
corrected. In the days that preceded the calamities
of which I speak Prussia had her prophets
crying to deaf men. Misfortune opened the ears
of the rulers so that the prophets might be heard.
Reforms were adopted out of which has grown
the Germany of today. They all looked toward
the unification of national energy, whatever its
form; but they are expressed in three notable
ways: universal military service, the correction
of waste energy in civil life, and the inculcation
of the spirit of obedience to authority. On these
principles chiefly a new Germany was built.</p>

<p>We have said a great deal recently about
crushing the German military system. Probably
we do not know just what we mean in saying
this. At least, it was not always our habit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
to decry the system. Many a time we have
spoken with admiration of the reforms of
Scharnhorst, of the glory of Leipzig and of the
services of Blücher at Waterloo. If we stop to
think we shall see that our real objection is the
purpose for which the German military system
has been used. And it seems that if it is to be
broken into pieces it must be opposed with a
stronger system built on a similar plan.</p>

<p>The next period that expresses Germany’s
peculiar spirit is the era of Bismarck, 1862 to
1890. It was the time of the cult of iron. Bismarck
was the “Iron Chancellor,” the nation offered
its enemies “blood and iron.” Iron cannon,
iron words, and iron laws became the ideals
of the people. Statesmen, historians, poets, editors,
professors, and all other patriots began to
worship according to the rite of the new cult.
And iron entered into the blood of the Germans.</p>

<p>To carry out Bismarck’s policy it was necessary
to break down a promising liberal movement
that seemed on the point of giving Prussia responsible
government. It was his faith that a
united Germany must hew her way into the position
of great power in Europe, and in order to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
have a state that could do this there must be a
strong central authority, able to direct all the
resources of the state to the desired end. The
large number of small nobles had long ago
formed the celebrated Junker autocracy, a body
with like ideals. He gave their restless energy
a more definite political and military object, and
made them take places as parts of his great state
machine.</p>

<p>He had his reward. In 1866 he fought a decisive
war against Prussia’s old enemy, Austria,
and won it so quickly that even the Prussians
were astonished. In 1870&ndash;1871 he threw the
state against France in a war that left the land
of Napoleon as completely at his feet as Prussia
had been at the feet of the Corsican. And then
in the moment of exultation over the victory he
founded the German empire by uniting with
Prussia the numerous smaller German states.
There is much to support the suggestion that a
similar stroke is held in reserve to create a Mittel-Europa
of Germany and Austria-Hungary as a
final glory of the present war, if Germany shows
herself able to carry off the victory.</p>

<p>Bismarck’s ambition for Germany was to hold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
a position of arbiter in Continental affairs. He
felt that this was the best way to make his country
safe from hostile combinations, and it met
his ideal of the dignity to which Germany ought
to attain. He achieved his desire in the Three
Emperors’ League and the Triple Alliance.
Predominance in influence was the height of his
ambition. The conquest of new lands, and the
support of industry and trade by a policy of territorial
expansion, were not within his plans.
He was a man of an older generation to whom
a predominance among the Great Powers was
better than chasing the rainbow of world empire.</p>

<p>In 1888 died Wilhelm I, the king whom Bismarck
made Emperor. He was an honest man
who loved the simple and sound Germany in
which he was reared. At this time the leading
men of 1871 were passing from power and a
group was coming on the scene who were young
men in the intoxicating times of Sedan and Metz.
A new emperor came to the throne, possessing
great energy and the capacity of forming vast
plans. He was eleven years old when the empire
was proclaimed at Versailles, the age at
which ordinary boys begin to wake from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
dreams of childhood. From such dreams Wilhelm
II passed to dreams of imperial glory.
The idea of bigness of authority that he thus
formed has remained with him to this day. Add
the effects of an impulsive disposition and an unusual
amount of confidence in himself and you
will account for the peculiar gloss spread over a
character that is strong and otherwise wholesome.</p>

<p>Early in his reign he gave ground for alarm
by several acts that are hardly to be described
in a less severe word than “bumptious.” He
dismissed Bismarck from the Chancellorship,
seemingly for no other reason than that he wished
a chancellor who would be more obedient to the
imperial will, and he uttered many sentiments
which caused sober men to wonder what kind of
emperor he was going to be. But as the years
passed it was noticed that all his aberrations fell
short of disaster, and as he was very energetic
and devoted to efficiency in civil and military
matters the world came at last to regard him
with real esteem.</p>

<p>When the present war began the kaiser became
its leader, as was his duty and privilege. Opinion
in hostile countries pronounced him the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
agent responsible for its outbreak. Around his
striking personality have collected many stories
of dark complexion. At this time it is not
possible to test their accuracy, but it is safe to
say that many of them are chiefly assumption.
On the other hand, it is undoubted that he is now
a firm friend of the military party, and that he
supports the autocracy in its purpose to carry
the war to the bitter end. He has been a diligent
war lord and he has shown a willingness to
share the sacrifices of the people. Stories of apparent
reliability that have come out of Germany
in recent months imply that he has steadily
gained in popularity during the conflict, while
most of the other members of his family have
lost.</p>

<p>If it is important to clear thinking to see the
kaiser in an impartial light, it is equally necessary
to understand the German <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kultur</i>. This
term is used in Germany to indicate the mass of
ideas and habits of thought of a people. It applies
to art and industry, to religion and war, to
whatever the human mind directs. From the
German’s standpoint we have a <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kultur</i> of our
own. We have no corresponding term, nor concept,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
and we cannot realize all he means in using
the term if we do not put ourselves in his place.
Now it is true that the German has won great
success in intellectual ways. Scholarship, scientific
invention, the application of art to industry,
and well planned efficiency in social organization
are his in a large degree. He is proud of his
achievements; and when the war began he felt
that it was the German mission to give this <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kultur</i>
to other peoples. From his standpoint, a
Germanized world would be a world made
happy. It was an honest opinion, and it went
far to support his desire for expansion.</p>

<p>The Germans are a docile people with respect
to their superiors, and this trait is a condition of
their <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kultur</i>. It is traditional in Germany for
the peasant to obey his lord, the lord to obey his
over-lord, and the over-lord to obey his ruler.
To the kaiser look all the people in a sense which
no citizen of the United States can understand
without using a fair amount of imagination.
The lords and over-lords constitute the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Junkers</i>,
who in the modern military system make up the
officer class. A high sense of authority runs
through the whole population, the upper classes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
knowing how to give orders and the lower classes
knowing how to take them.</p>

<p>Before the battle of Jena, 1806, the Prussian
army was made up of peasants forced to serve
under the nobles, who took the offices. Townsmen
were excluded from the army. The peasant’s
forced service lasted twenty years. The
system was as inefficient as it was unequal, and
a commission was appointed to reform it. The
result was the modern system of universal service,
put into complete operation in 1813. After
a hundred years it is possible to see some of the
effects of the system on the ideals of the people.
It has taught them to work together in their
places, formed habits of promptness and cleanliness,
and lessened the provincialism of the lower
classes. It has been a great training school in
nationalism, preserving the love of country and
instilling in the minds of the masses a warm devotion
to the military traditions of the nation.</p>

<p>It has also produced results of a questionable
value. By fostering the military spirit it has developed
a desire for war, on the same principle
that a boy in possession of a sharp hatchet has a
strong impulse to hack away at his neighbor’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
shrubbery. It is probable that the temptation
to use a great and superior army was a vital fact
in bringing on the present war. Furthermore,
the wide-spread habit of docility leaves a people
without self-assertion and enables their rulers to
impose upon them. As to the influence of universal
service in promoting militarism, that has
been frequently mentioned.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it should be borne in mind
that not all states that have had universal military
training have been saddled with these evils.
France, for example, has had universal training
without becoming obsessed with the passion for
war and without the loss of popular individualism.
It seems well to say that universal training
itself does not produce the evils sometimes attributed
to it. In Germany, at least, it seems
that it was the purpose for which the army existed,
and not the army itself, that developed
militarism and brought other unhappy effects.</p>

<p>Probably the German army before the war was
the most efficient great human machine then in
existence. There was less waste in it and less
graft than in any other army. Since the army
included all the men of the empire at some stage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
or other of their existence, it was a great training
school in organization. Its effects on German
history are hardly to be exaggerated.</p>

<p>I have said that military organization alone
was not sufficient to make the modern Germany.
It was also necessary to give the nation a definite
national purpose, and this was the task of its
intellectual leaders. The purpose itself was expressed
in the idea of German nationality. By
a bold stretch of fancy every part of Europe
that had once been ruled by Germans, that
spoke the German language, or that could be
considered as a part that ought to speak that
language was fixed upon as territory to be
brought within the authority of the Fatherland.
It was in accordance with this principle that
Schleswig-Holstein was taken from Denmark
in 1864 and Alsace-Lorraine in 1871. Here the
march of annexation paused. Bismarck was too
wise to carry the theory to an extreme; but a
growing number of writers and speakers in the
empire took up the idea and kept it before the
people with winning persistence. It is thus that
Pan-Germanism has come to be one of the great
facts in German public opinion. By preaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
race unity with patriotic zeal the intellectual leaders
have established a powerful propaganda of
expansion.</p>

<p>Of the men most prominently associated with
this movement especial attention must be given
to Heinrich von Treitschke, for years professor
of Modern and Contemporary History at the
University of Berlin, whose remarkable influence
reached all classes of people. He was a handsome
man with an open face that invited admiration
without appearing to care whether it was
given or not. When he spoke the auditor heard
“a raucous, half-strangled, uneasy voice” and
noticed that his movements were mechanical and
his utterances were without regard to the pauses
that usually stand for commas and periods, while
his pleasant facial expression had no apparent
relation to what he was saying. The explanation
was that he was so deaf that he did not hear
himself speak. That such a speaker could fire
the heart of a nation is evidence that he was filled
with unusual earnestness and sympathy.</p>

<p>He had great love of country, and if he exalted
royalty and strong government it was because he
thought that Germany would reach her highest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
authority through them. It was no selfish or incompetent
king that he worshiped, but one that
lived righteously and sought diligently to promote
the interest of the people. He held that the
nobility should serve as thoroughly as the common
men. Strong government in his idea did
not mean privilege, as ordinarily understood, but
vital energy in all the organs of administration,
efficiently directed by a will that was not hampered
by the contrarywise tugging of individual
opinions.</p>

<p>Treitschke’s penetrating eloquence was heard
throughout the land. Editors, preachers of religion,
schoolmasters, authors, members of the
legislative assemblies, high officials, and even ministers
of state came to his class-room and went
away to carry his ideas into other channels. He
inspired the men who did the actual thinking for
the nation. All his efforts were expended for
what he considered the enhancement of Germany’s
position among nations.</p>

<p>In giving him his due we must not overlook his
faults. He was narrow in his ideas of international
relations. His exaltation of Germany
would have left other nations at her mercy. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
seems to have had small respect for the principle
of live-and-let-live among states. As much as
any one in his country he was responsible for the
idea that the British are a pack of hypocrites, offering
inferior races the Bible with one hand and
opium with the other. That they had not a good
record with respect to the opium trade is true,
but it was sheer narrowness to make it the chief
characteristic of a people who have done a great
work in behalf of the backward races.</p>

<p>Although Treitschke wrote many pamphlets
on topics of current interest, all bearing upon
what he considered the destiny of Germany, he
was preëminently a historian. It was by telling
the story of Germany since the revival of national
feeling after the battle of Jena that he
wished to serve best the generation in which he
lived. For him it was the historian to whom was
committed the task of making the citizen realize
what place he had in the nation’s complex of
duties and hopes.</p>

<p>He came upon the scene when history had become
fixed upon the basis of accuracy and detached
research. Men like Leopold von Ranke
had insisted that history should deal with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
cold exploitation of universal laws. For them
Treitschke was a bad historian, and they used
their influence to prevent his appointment at the
University of Berlin. He was a Chauvinist, undoubtedly,
and his <cite>History of Germany in the
Nineteenth Century</cite> is a highly colored picture
of what he conceived the reader should know
about the history of his country. It is a work
written to arouse the enthusiasm of the people for
their country, rather than to instruct them in the
universal laws of human development; and it
would be a sad day for the world if all history
were written as he wrote this. But it was a
powerful appeal to national pride and energy.
It played a great part in the formation of the
Germany with which we are concerned in this
chapter, the striving, self-confident, and aspiring
empire that set for itself the task of dominating
the European continent.</p>

<p>This chapter is not written to reconcile American
readers to the German side of the controversy
that now engages the attention of all men.
I wish to enable the reader to have a clear view
of the people with whom we fight. It is they
with whom we must deal in building up the system<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
out of which the future is to be constructed
again; and we shall not know how to deal with
them if we do not see their point of view and
know what they are thinking about.</p>

<p>If in some of their ideals they are superior to
other peoples, and if their organization of individuals
into the state has some elements of
strength not found in other systems, it is not for
us to seek to destroy the advantage they have
won. It would be better for us to adopt their
good points, in order that we might the more
surely defeat them on the field of battle. Having
won the victory we desire, we should certainly
not seek to destroy that which we cannot
replace. Live and let live, a principle which
Germans have ignored in some important respects,
must be recognized after the military ambition
of Germany is broken, if we are to have
an enduring peace.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE FAILURE OF THE OLD EUROPEAN SYSTEM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Much has been written to prove that one side
or the other was responsible for the present war.
Minute facts, as the words in a dispatch, or the
time at which the troops were mobilized, or
whether or not a preliminary summons of troops
to the colors was in itself an act of mobilization,
have become the subjects of bitter debate. Such
questions will have to be settled by the historians
of the future years: they cannot be discussed
here with any profit, since this book is an appeal
to the reason of men on each side of the controversy.</p>

<p>Back of the events of July, 1914, is a more
fundamental cause of the war. It is the breakdown
of the systems of concert and balance to
which the powers had trusted themselves. Castlereagh
and Metternich allowed themselves to
slip into these theories, when they set aside the
suggestion of a federated Europe, which came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
from Alexander I. Granted that the tsar’s
dream was too ethereal for a world steeped in selfishness,
it does not follow that a policy entirely
devoted to the balancing of selfishness with selfishness
would have preserved peace.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we must admit that nations
are not idealists. Selfishness is their doctrine.
So long as the project of a federation is viewed
idealistically it is practically impossible. But if
it ever comes to be admitted by the people who
count in political things that it is for the interests
of the nations to adopt it, that is, if it is brought
within what we may call the sphere of selfishness,
it ceases to be idealistic and comes to be a subject
worthy of the consideration of the practical
statesman.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the political philosopher has
ever to answer the question, “What about the
future?” What are we going to do after the
present debauch of waste and murder is over?
Are we to trust the world to the same old forces
that brought us this ruin? One says that human
nature is the same forever, that it learns only in
the hard school of experience, and that it must
fight its wars as the price it pays for being human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
nature. To such a man the Napoleonic wars
did all that could be expected of them when they
so impressed the world with the cost of war that
a system was adopted which gave the world a
measure of peace for a hundred years. “What
more can you ask?” said such a philosopher to me.
In humble responsibility to the throne of reason I
reply that we can try as intelligent beings to remove
the war madness permanently, making it
our duty to posterity to do the best we can.
Some generation must make the start, or we shall
wring our hands forever.</p>

<p>In this chapter I wish to show in what way the
old system crumbled before the desire of world
power. It seems a vicious system by virtue of
its innate qualities of selfishness, and it is all
the more to be feared because its subtle spirit
gets control of our own hearts as well as the
hearts of other men. While our opponents&mdash;Germany
and Austria&mdash;were following the system
to its bitter conclusion, our friends&mdash;Great
Britain, France, and Italy&mdash;were doing nearly
the same things, but in a slightly different way.
And there is no reason to expect that under the
continuation of the balancing of great and ambitious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
world powers we shall have more respect
for the rights of one another than we had in the
past.</p>

<p>The system of Balance of Power flourished best
in Bismarck’s time. It was his strong personality
that held together the Three Emperors’
League for a brief season and the Triple Alliance
for a longer period. Each of these groups
had certain interests in common which gave them
coherence: Bismarck alone knew how to exploit
these mutual advantages and lessen the jars of
clashing feelings. His objects were made easier
by the fact that most of the other nations of
Europe at that time had developed quarrels of
their own. Great Britain and Russia were at
swords’ points over the Far Eastern question, and
France and Great Britain had not forgotten their
century old antagonism, which only a minor dispute
was sufficient to set aflame.</p>

<p>Moreover, Great Britain was engaged in a vast
task of empire building. Manufactures increased
rapidly in the United Kingdom, an ever
growing trade threw out ever expanding tentacles
to the remotest parts of the world, and the
growth of the colonies produced greater prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
at home and abroad than the most hopeful
Briton had previously thought within the
bounds of probability. She was too busy with
this splendid process of internal prosperity to
take notice of what was happening on the Continent,
so long as her own interests were not threatened.
From her standpoint Bismarck’s policy of
preserving peace through the means of a German
predominating influence was a welcome relief
from other burdens.</p>

<p>This state of affairs was prolonged for at least
fifteen years after the death of Bismarck.
Kaiser Wilhelm II’s temperamental impetuousness
did not break up the balance that had been
established, although many prophets had foretold
such a thing. As the corner-stone of the Triple
Alliance Germany was looked upon as the protector
of European peace, and the kaiser, it is
said, was pleased to regard himself as the man
especially responsible for that policy.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say when and how this happy
situation began to be undermined and whose was
the responsibility. One cause of the rupture was
the rapid growth of German manufactures and
trade, which brought about stern competition between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
the business interests of Germany and
Great Britain. The newspapers of the two nations,
like all other newspapers of modern times,
were closely connected with the capitalistic interests
of the respective states, and voiced the
alarm and antipathy of the industrial classes.
Thus the people of Germany and the people of
Britain were stimulated to a condition of mutual
distrust. They believed that each practiced the
most disreputable tricks of competition against
the other, and each talked of destroying the industry
of the other. It is difficult to say who is
responsible for the beginning of commercial
rivalry.</p>

<p>Late in the last century Germany began to enlarge
her navy with the evident purpose of making
it rival the navy of Great Britain. Her
justification was found in the idea that a navy
was necessary to protect the great commerce that
she was building up. At the same time German
writers began to make many criticisms on the
British claim of being mistress of the seas.
“Freedom of the seas” became a phrase of comfort
in their mouths. It is not clear that it meant
what it seemed to say; for the seas were as free to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
the Germans in times of peace as to any other
people, and Germany’s plan to build a great
fleet that would defeat the British fleet would
establish that same kind of rule at sea that Great
Britain through her naval superiority then held.</p>

<p>Now it is very certain that Germany had a perfect
right to enter each of these two fields of
endeavor. The contests of industry are open
to all, and the laws of peace protect them. She
had the right, also, to build up her navy, although
she should not have expected to overtop
the British navy specifically without arousing the
hostility of the British people. The insular position
of the United Kingdom and its relations with
its colonies are such that a navy is its surest protection
if assailed in war; and to fall into a second
position is to hold its life at the permission of
another state. Germany must have seen this
phase of the situation. Her statesmen were poor
leaders of men if they did not realize that they
were entering upon a rivalry in which was the possibility
of great resistance.</p>

<p>Another phase of the opposition that was
steadily rising against Germany was the general
alarm at the growth of her military power. Her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
army and navy ever increased in size and readiness
for that initial rush to victory which is half
the struggle in modern war. At the same time
German leaders did not disguise their desire for
the enlargement of German territory on the Continent.
The Pan-German party made a great
deal of noise, and other nations were not reassured
by being told that the party was not as
strong as its agitation seemed to indicate.</p>

<p>Now and again one read in some German paper
an assertion to the effect that Germany was
bound to become the dominant power in Europe
and that she would next turn on the United
States. How many Americans have not heard
some over-confident German friend make a
prophecy of like import? It was evident that
many Germans regarded the great republic of the
West as an over-fattened commercial nation without
the power of resistance and destined at the
proper time to furnish rich nourishment for their
conquering arms. That we considered these
thoughts but the idle boasts of a nation intoxicated
by success did not lessen the conviction of
ourselves and others that Germany was running
into a state of mind that required coöperative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
measures of resistance on the part of people who
might become victims of her infatuation.</p>

<p>While these two processes of national feeling
ran their courses, several political events, which
have already been described added vigor to the
antagonism that was rising against Germany.
Her attitude toward the Boers when they were
at war against Great Britain was one, Delcassé’s
wise adjustment of the Fashoda incident was
another, his clever formation of the <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente Cordiale</cite>
between France and Britain was another,
the conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese alliance
was still another, the defeat of Russia by Japan
and her elimination as a threat against British
interests in India was another, and the formation
of the Triple <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> by Great Britain, France,
and Russia, announced in 1907, was the final act
of the series. Great Britain was not only again
seriously concerned in Continental affairs, but a
combination had been formed of three great
European nations, with the strongest power of
the East as a flying buttress, to hold back the
much dreaded aggressions of the Triple Alliance,
consisting of Germany, Austria, and Italy. The
Balance of Power had come to its most logical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
state of development; for instead of having one
great state balancing between the other states
around it, we now had the great states of the
world ranged in two camps, each side checking
the other in the belief that in so doing it was preserving
the world from war.</p>

<p>It is hard to establish a balance when two
opposing sides are strong and mutually jealous
of one another; for the opposition of forces is
then formed to secure mutual advantages, and
not to promote the common interest through the
preservation of equilibrium. In such a case one
side or the other, possibly each side, is apt to
fancy itself the stronger, and if it acts on that
assumption it arouses the apprehension of the
other which finds itself tempted to make a counter
stroke. Once such a step is taken equilibrium
is lost. This is what happened in 1914. The
train of events that led up to the destruction of
the international balance is now to be described.</p>

<p>Here we must go back to the days when Delcassé
was foreign secretary in Paris, 1898&ndash;1905.
One of his achievements was to come to agreement
with Spain and Italy in reference to the
northern coast of Africa. He effected a treaty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
with the former nation by which French and
Spanish spheres of influence in Morocco were
defined, and another with Italy by which the right
of France in Tunis was accorded in exchange for
recognition of the right of Italy to Tripoli and
Cyrenaica.</p>

<p>Making this treaty by Italy did not constitute
treason to the Triple Alliance, since it was clearly
advantageous for Italy without infringing the
rights of either Germany or Austria; but it
alarmed Germany, already drawing close to Turkey,
because the object of Italian policy was to
get territory over which Turkey had a vital
claim. Nor was it pleasant for the kaiser to see
one of the members of the Triple Alliance acting
in coöperation with the members of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i>
in so important a matter.</p>

<p>Taking these achievements in connection with
the formation of the Dual Alliance and the mutual
approach of France and Great Britain, Germany
had reason to feel that she was being isolated.
Her whole population resented this turn
of events, seeing in it a sort of challenge hurled
forth by France, who at last found herself strong
enough to assume a position of self-assertion. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
is true that Delcassé only placed Germany in
a position of isolation like that which Bismarck
imposed on France for many years; and it was, in
strict logic, as fair for him to treat Germany
thus as for Bismarck to isolate France. Let
Germany submit to her fate, as France submitted,
when she had to submit. But we are not
dealing with logical matters here. It is a plain
fact that confronts us. Germany, who had
been strong through three decades without seeking
to expand her territory, suddenly realized that
her opponents were forming a combination
stronger than hers, their acquisition of territory
that followed set her in a rage, and she made
plans for getting her share in the world that was
to be taken. Under the system of balance then
recognized as the proper means of regulating
international relations her course was a natural
result of Delcassé’s policy.</p>

<p>The particular portion of the earth to which
she turned her eyes was Turkey. While she supported
the plans of Austria-Hungary to acquire
territory on the Adriatic, she herself looked
further to the East. She encouraged the party
at Constantinople known as the “Young Turks,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
she furnished improved arms to the Turkish
army, she formed plans to establish her influence
in Palestine, and she projected a great railroad to
Bagdad in the center of the Euphrates-Tigris
Valley. It was a sphere of influence that might
be considered more than a fair offset for the lands
her rivals were about to gain.</p>

<p>At the same time Germany found a means of
restoring her prestige, which was sorely wilted by
the progress of her rivals. The occasion arose in
connection with France’s occupation of Morocco,
which had begun without the aid or consent of the
kaiser.</p>

<p>Morocco had long been under a line of independent
sultans. Most of her commerce was
with Great Britain although German capitalists
had received concessions within her border. As
the country next to the French province of Algeria,
France looked upon it as her own particular
sphere of influence. We have already seen
that Italy conceded this claim, 1901, while France
conceded Italy’s claim to Tripoli and Cyrenaica.
In 1904 France conceded Great Britain’s practical
supremacy in Egypt and in return was assured
the protectorate over Morocco. She asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
no concession from Germany but came to an
agreement with Spain, who had a small strip of
territory south of the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>In 1905 Delcassé was quietly preparing to
carry out his plan for the development of Morocco,
when the kaiser landed in Tangiers without
the slightest warning, and announced in a public
address that he had come to visit his friend, the
independent sultan of Morocco, in whose country
all foreign nations had equal rights. The speech
was received by the world as a challenge to
France and a means of announcing that Germany
was no longer to be ignored. The moment
of the landing at Tangiers was well chosen by the
kaiser; for only three weeks earlier Russia, the
ally of France, had been defeated by the Japanese
at Mukden and could give her no assistance.</p>

<p>In this unfortunate situation it was necessary
for France to bend before the storm. She agreed
to submit the whole Moroccan question to an international
congress, thus appealing to the principle
of the Concert of Europe, and when she
learned that the kaiser demanded that she dismiss
the minister whose hands had been played<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
so skillfully against Germany, she agreed to that
also.</p>

<p>The dismissal of Delcassé recalls an incident of
1807. In that year Napoleon forced the king of
Prussia to dismiss Stein, his great minister, who
was bending all his efforts to reëstablish Prussia
on a war footing. It marked the triumph of
Napoleon’s power for the time being, but it
was a futile action; for Stein out of office under
such circumstances had more influence than ever,
and the shameful way in which he was treated
only emphasized Prussia’s humiliation and made
the Prussians more determined than ever to assert
their national power. Similar results in
France in 1905 followed the stab given to that
nation’s faithful and efficient minister.</p>

<p>The international congress assembled at Algeciras
in 1906. It adopted a compromise decision,
which gave something to each side and satisfied
neither. Germany was supposed to have
gained when the congress recognized the territorial
integrity of Morocco under the sovereignty
of the sultan and guaranteed equal rights of trade
in the country to the citizens of all the signatory
powers. On the other hand, France and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Spain were jointly to have the right to instruct
and furnish officers for the Moroccan police force.
Winning in a quarrel rarely makes the victor
think well of the vanquished. Certainly Germany,
who had now blocked the plans of France,
was not less bitter in her attitude toward that
nation; while France, feeling that she had been
caught at a disadvantage, smothered her indignation
and waited for the opportunity to make
things even.</p>

<p>In 1907 disturbances occurred in Moroccan
ports and French marines were landed to preserve
order. When they were not withdrawn in
a year Germany protested and an irritating
diplomatic discussion followed. At last Germany
was persuaded to submit the point actually
at issue to the Hague tribunal, whose decision
was not conclusive and satisfied neither side.
Then a Franco-German convention was held to
pass on the rights of each nation in Morocco.
Its decision, given in February, 1909, announced
that the interest of Germany in the province was
only economic; and as France agreed to give
equal protection in such matters, the kaiser
promised he would not interfere in the country.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
In each of these incidents war seemed about to
begin, and Europe awaited the results in great
anxiety. When the clouds lifted the nations
breathed freely again.</p>

<p>Still there was no way under the existing system
to solve the difficulty that presented itself,
had Germany only decided that she would not
trust her cause to peaceful negotiation. The
fact that she took such a step was to her own
people but a mark of the kaiser’s love of peace.
This and similar incidents, in which the militarists
carried their country to the verge of war only
to be held back by the hand of the emperor served
to lay the foundation for that popular belief
in Germany that a peace policy had been steadily
followed under provocations and that Europe
was indebted to Wilhelm II for immunity from
war. In reality the system of balance of power
had needlessly brought the world to the verge of
a bitter and unnecessary conflict.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the war clouds lifted
Europe had evidence of the small amount of
tolerance the leading classes of Germany had for
the slightest manifestation of the spirit of compromise
in the matter under discussion. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
chancellor under whom the recent settlement was
made was von Bülow, who thought it better to
adjust so small a quarrel than to incur the responsibility
of war. His action received the
stern denunciation of the military party. So
strong was the criticism that he was forced to
retire from office, his place going to Bethmann-Hollweg,
who had the support of the militarists.
The only explanation to be advanced for this
turn of the affair is that the German national
spirit was so much excited by the long agitation
of men like Treitschke that a concession which
others might consider only trifling seemed to
them a sacrifice of national honor.</p>

<p>In 1911 occurred a third Moroccan incident, in
which Bethmann-Hollweg took occasion to recover
some of the attitude of assertiveness that
von Bülow had given up in 1909. In pursuance
of their plan to extend their protectorate over
Morocco the French occupied Fez with a military
force. A short time later the German warship
<i>Panther</i> entered the Moroccan port of Agadir,
ostensibly to protect German property. It was
soon known that the German government proposed
to hold the <i>Panther</i> at Agadir until the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
French withdrew from Fez. The war spirit
again flared up. Russia still suffered from the
wounds received from the hands of the Japanese,
which Germany well knew; but Great Britain
was in fighting condition and announced her support
of France. After a short discussion Germany
took a more complaisant attitude, and a
settlement was made whereby the French were
allowed a protectorate over Morocco on condition
that they guarantee an “open door” in Moroccan
trade and transfer to Germany two valuable
strips of territory in the French Congo region.</p>

<p>Again Europe breathed easily, and again wise
men reflected that no real settlement had been
made. France had been bluffed out of a valuable
portion of her Congo colony and was not
disposed to endure the affront longer than was
necessary. Some day Russia would be fully restored
to her strength and ready to help her ally
in the face of German aggression. Until then
France would have to yield. Meanwhile she
was consoled by the reflection that Great Britain
had pronounced for her openly. That was something
to take to heart. The great sea power,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
though slow to anger, was at last conscious of her
danger if Germany overran France and seized a
channel port.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Germany was not fully
pleased at the outcome of the affair. The appearance
of Great Britain in it was an indication
that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> was a thing of vitality. Germany
had been forced to moderate her demands,
taking colonial territory while her whole thought
for the future was not developing African colonies
but curbing the power of France. Not only
was France not checked, but she was much
strengthened in a vital part of her power. She
had acquired lands in just the region that she
needed them to carry out her ambition to control
the western end of the Mediterranean. If some
day Spain were to become a republic, could she
fail to establish cordial relations with the republic
of France, and thus be swept into the anti-German
group? It may well be that in these reflections
were born two German impulses: first to
win Great Britain to some kind of a compromise
with Germany, detaching her, at least for a time,
from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i>; and second, to strike a vital
blow before Russia was entirely recovered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Within the next three years she acted on each
of these impulses.</p>

<p>At the same time it became evident that the
Triple Alliance was crumbling, and this was another
source of anxiety to Germany. It meant
that she should hasten her steps if she was to carry
forward her great purpose. It was in September,
1911, while the Agadir incident was still
unsettled, that Italy began the war with Turkey
to establish control of Tripoli and Cyrenaica. In
view of Germany’s well-known friendliness with
Turkey, this step was most unexpected. It
could only mean that Italy was not disposed to
subordinate her own interests to those of Germany
at Constantinople. If she had not felt certain
of support by the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> powers, in case
Germany turned on her, she would hardly have
ventured to begin the war.</p>

<p>Another advance made by <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> powers
within the period under consideration was in
Persia. This ancient state was in sad disorder.
Weak and unpatriotic shahs, bold bands of
brigands, and foreign intrigues plunged it into
such a condition that it invited the domination of
foreign nations. Russia approached from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
north, and Great Britain appeared in the south,
where rich oil fields had caught her eye.</p>

<p>After some initial gains the two powers
came to an agreement in 1907 by which they
established their respective spheres of influence,
so that Persia was occupied at the two ends,
north and south, by strong powers, and the middle
portion was in such a chaotic state that its
future seemed very doubtful. By making loans
to the shah and furnishing capital for public improvements
British and Russian capitalists enabled
their respective countries to tighten their
grips on Persia. Soon that country was in the
throes of revolution, a so-called Nationalist party
came into power which was not able to rule without
the aid of Russia and Great Britain. So far
did the foreign influence go that Morgan W.
Shuster, an American financial adviser of the
shah who had tried hard to place the government
on a satisfactory basis, was fain to withdraw from
Persia in despair. To the rest of the world it
seemed that the independence of the country was
near its end.</p>

<p>A mere glance will show us what these developments
meant for Germany and Austria-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>Hungary.
Remembering that Italy was acting
with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> in her African policy, we
see that the entire southern shore of the Mediterranean
was passing into hands adverse to the
central powers, and that the new combination
stretched out a long arm to the Persian Gulf and
the region south of the Caspian. In view of
Germany’s hope that she would some day gain
through Syria a railway route to the Far East,
the trend of things in Persia threatened to close
the narrow gap that was left her for such a route
by completing the absorption of the kingdom of
the shah. Should she allow the gap to be
stopped, or should she strike while there was still
time? And if she did not strike, what was there
in the system of the Balance of Power that could
be counted on as a guarantee that she was not a
passive victim to the play of politics in the system
then in use?</p>

<p>Furthermore, it was evident that Germany’s
prestige was being undermined by the progressive
steps of her rivals. Three times had she
rattled the saber over the Moroccan incidents,
and each time with decreasing terror in the minds
of her opponents. Perhaps its rattling had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
one of the main facts in promoting the union of
those opponents, since it always brought before
them the picture of Germany embattled against
the rest of Europe. To strike a blow that would
teach France and Russia a lesson would restore
German prestige and bring the balance back to
the German side of the rivalry, if it did not do
more.</p>

<p>There is good ground for the guess that it was
expected in high quarters in Berlin that the blow
would do far more than restore prestige. It is
true that the plan to which I am about to refer
has not been openly accepted by responsible
agents of state, but it was widely advocated by
a portion of the people, the Pan-Germans. It
involved the union of Austria-Hungary and Germany
in a great state, Mittel-Europa, with strong
influence in the Near East. Treitschke and
many others had written and spoken for such a
thing, and to a large number of Germans it had
become a sacred ideal. When some one spoke to
the deaf Colussus about the acquisition of territory
in Africa he exclaimed: “Cameroons?
What are we to do with this sand-box? Let us
take Holland; then we shall have colonies.” It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
was a part of the dream of the Pan-Germans
that the proposed Mittel-Europa should extend
from the Baltic to the Black Sea. If such a thing
could be carried through, how excellent a trump
card to play against the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> plotters!</p>

<p>Francis Joseph, of Austria-Hungary, was too
stout a patriot to hand his country over to the
schemes of the Pan-Germans, but he was approaching
an already long deferred demise.
The heir-apparent, Ferdinand, was supposed to
be a great admirer of the kaiser, and the advocates
of union had high hopes that he would promote
their desires. Suddenly came the crime of
Sarajevo. In a peculiar manner it dashed the
hopes of the dreamers; for not only was their chief
reliance taken away, but the new heir-apparent
was supposed to be a pacific man who would
favor constitutional government. Such a ruler
would hardly support the formation of a great
empire built after the fashion of Prussian autocracy.
It was the inspiration of the moment to
have the war come, and demonstrate the glory of
Germany and Austria-Hungary, while the old
emperor still lived. And if it was precipitated
in the interest of Austria-Hungary, that was all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the greater reason that the people of the dual
empire should feel under obligation to the military
power that carried it through. Possibly
they would be so much impressed that they would
sweep a youthful emperor on with them in the
realization of a great united empire.</p>

<p>It is not certain how far the Pan-German party
controlled the policy of government in July,
1914; but it does not seem too much to attribute
such plans to men who did not hesitate to dream
of the annexation of Holland and who had definitely
planned for the acquisition of Constantinople.
The imagination of a German patriot is
no mean thing in ordinary situations; but a great
sweep would be vouchsafed to it when its possessor
realized that his country was being outplayed
by the diplomats and the grim Captain of
Death. It was an extraordinary situation that
the Germans confronted in July, 1914, and there
was not much time for deliberation.</p>

<p>This chapter is not written to show that Germany
was, or was not, responsible for the war.
If it explains how it was that the German people
believed that the war was forced on them, it will
accomplish more than it was designed to accomplish.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
But it is intended to enable persons to
keep calm heads in these times of perplexity in
order to understand how each side approached
the great conflict. It is evident that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i>
powers thought that Germany wished to change
Europe into a great empire with herself at the
head, while the central powers felt that the chains
were being riveted around about them.</p>

<p>In view of this long train of events the last
week in that fateful July assumes small proportions.
If Ferdinand had not been killed war
would still have hung over the horizon. If Serbia
had accepted the Austrian ultimatum war
would still have threatened; for though it may
have been averted for the moment, the Triple
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> would still have existed, nor would it
have brooked the increase of German prestige
that the backdown of Serbia would have implied.
If Russia had not mobilized her army, Germany
may not have mobilized, but the ancient fear of
Russia as an overwhelming opponent when
she was once organized in the modern way
would have remained as a threat of dire consequences.</p>

<p>The theory of the Balance of Power is built<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
upon the idea that states act for their own interests
in the restraint of one another from overweening
ambition. At bottom it is selfish. It
assumes a state of rivalry; and it is necessary to
the theory that as fast as one side gains in
strength the other shall gain also. If the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i>
nations acquire Morocco, Tripoli, Cyrenaica,
and parts of Persia, the central powers
must gain also or they are over-balanced. And
who is to determine how much they shall gain?
Manifestly each will strive to get all it can. The
very process of gaining stimulates antipathy and
makes war a probability.</p>

<p>Another observation that is worthy of consideration
is that balance is logically possible only
when more than two sides are opposed to one
another. When Great Britain, France and
Russia had varying purposes it was not difficult
for Bismarck to play one against the other and
so keep the equilibrium. But when it happened
that the central powers became so strong that
they constituted a threat against every other nation
in the world, it was natural for the other
nations to unite to check them. In such a condition
no true balance of power could exist, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
it was folly to expect that theory to serve as it
served in former days.</p>

<p>One of the things the world ought to learn
from the war that now afflicts it is that no nation
can conquer the world by stealth. It is one of
the happy shortcomings of political selfishness
that its agents usually fancy they can cover their
tracks. How often do we see a bad politician
doing something wrong in the false confidence
that while he knows what he is doing the people
cannot see it! So with Germany in the years
before the war. Making her plans for large
accretions of power, she thought she could steal
a march on other nations and gain in a spurt a
position from which at a later time she could extend
her power by other and still larger sweeps
of conquest. She did not think that the other
nations would take part until it was too late.</p>

<p>But the rest of the world was as wide awake
as she. No man in England accustomed to view
political things in the large failed to see the instant
the war began that the hour of crisis for
his country was at hand. If Great Britain had
not fought in August, 1914, she would have been
the stupidest nation in the world. To have allowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
her greatest rival to sit down in the French
channel ports would have been suicidal for her.
The only probable explanation of Germany’s failure
to realize this is that she had become so confident
of the superiority of her own mind that
she thought all other minds were sodden.</p>

<p>In a similar way, when she had carried on the
war for two years and a half and resorted to
the submarine in ruthless attacks on American
ships of commerce, she should have known that
she was giving the United States a reason for
participating in the war at a time when it was
clear to most Americans that their national safety
demanded that they should take part. If by this
kind of battle the Germans forced Europe to
bend to her, what could we expect in the future?
The very imminence of German success demanded
that the United States should throw herself
into the struggle. And after the war is
over this truth will be written indelibly in the
pages of history: No great nation can be allowed
to conquer the world piecemeal.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="subhead">IF THE SUBMARINES FAIL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The German people say the submarines will
not fail. They seem to think that what they call
the highest achievement of the scientific mind of
Germany cannot fail. There is little doubt
that they pin on this arm of the service their
last hope of securing a decision in actual warfare.
If it fails them they can look forward
only to a long course of sheer dogged resistance,
hoping they can last longer than their adversaries.
Let us consider the probable results respectively
of the success and the failure of the
submarine campaign.</p>

<p>If the under-sea boats do all the Germans
expect of them the result is soon told. Great
Britain will be forced to make lame and inefficient
war, France will be unable to do more
than hold on to the line that she occupies, and
the United States, unable to send her vast army
across the seas in large numbers, will not be able
to repair the loss of strength that her allies sustain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Under such circumstances Russia, even if
she should recover from her present state of
weakness, could hardly deliver the blows that
would bring Germany to reason.</p>

<p>Under such conditions the war would end without
the defeat of the Teutons, and Mittel-Europa
would still be impending. If the enthusiasm
of victory would stimulate such a union, the realization
that Germany and Austria-Hungary
were pressed back to the wall and must fight for
their future existence might equally bring them
to unite their fortunes. In fact, if these two
states wish to unite it is hard to see how they are
to be prevented, unless at the end of the war they
are so much weaker than their opponents that
they can be forbidden to take such a step, with
assurance that the prohibition will be respected.</p>

<p>To form such a union would be, in fact, to
snatch victory out of sore distress; for the united
empires, even though Serbia, Bulgaria, and Turkey
were left out of account, would have a population
of 116,000,000, which is more than the
population of the United States and smaller only
than that of Russia and China. Ten years’
breathing space in which to reorganize the industrial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
and social life of so large a body of men
would work wonders with them; and when reorganized
and fired by a common ambition they
would be able to dictate terms to any two of the
nations of Western Europe. It is the probable
union of these states rather than the power of
either when acting alone, that makes it necessary
for the rest of the world to procure their defeat.</p>

<p>In two ways the union can be prevented. One
is to inflict such a defeat on the central allies
that they will not dare run the risk of another
war through endeavoring to combine. Possibly
such a defeat could be inflicted by fighting long
and winning great victories. It would have to
be a greater victory than was won by Prussia
over France in 1871; for after that victory
France, fired with hatred for all that was German,
was so much feared by her conquerors that
it became a chief object of their diplomacy to
keep her isolated by drawing possible allies over
to the German interest. The great military
strength of Germany at present hardly warrants
the hope that she can be brought to a lower
state than France at the end of the siege of
Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
The other method is to bring about such a
situation that union shall not be desired in the
Teutonic states. For it is not to be disputed
that if ever a strong and competent group of
states wish to become an empire, nothing short of
a great war by other states can stop them.
It behooves us, therefore, to make our appeal to
the reasons of the Germans, Austrians and Hungarians.
It is not necessary to limit our arguments
to words merely; it is, however, essential
that the Teutonic mind shall understand what
to threaten the equilibrium of nations means.
To show that such a preponderance cannot be
established practically would be an effective
warning to those leaders who set up to preach
Germanic militarism in the future.</p>

<p>As this chapter is being printed, it seems that
the submarines are not a success. They have
taken a great toll but not all the grist. Enough
ships are left on the sea to carry the minimum of
food and war material that our allies must
have to maintain their grip on Germany. The
war of the central powers does not force their
enemies to their knees, and it seems that the best
the kaiser can hope for is to hold out for a time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
with the expectation that victory will be snatched
by accident out of the gloom that hangs over his
cause.</p>

<p>When the war began it was essentially a contest
between two groups of powers, each of which
had been pursuing policies of aggrandizement.
One group had progressively acquired territory
in Africa and Asia, and the other had a plan
equally definite for acquiring territory in Southeastern
Europe and the Near East. If the war
had been fought out as begun it would probably
have led to the realization of one or the other of
these desires. Either the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> powers would
have fixed their hold on their respective spheres
of influence and broken the schemes of Germany
and Austria-Hungary, or Germany would have
made a great sweep forward and established herself
in the keystone position of Europe, with immense
consequences for the future.</p>

<p>As the war progressed it became evident that
it was becoming a supreme test of the ability of
one combination of nations to create a new empire
that would dominate Europe. It is no stretch
of imagination to say that the Germans dreamed
of reëstablishing a modern Roman Empire of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
the Germans. If the scheme had materialized&mdash;and
the future historian will probably conclude
that it was near success at one time&mdash;the fate
of the rest of the world would have been far
different from what we wish it to be. A gigantic
struggle would have been thrust upon the United
States to save the Western World from conquest.
It was the conviction that such a crisis
actually menaced us that brought us to join in the
attempt to block the German plans.</p>

<p>Assuming, therefore, that the anti-German allies
are victorious, it is unthinkable that the war
shall be allowed to end as a mere check on the
plans of the central powers. To do so would
be to grant that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> powers should be
left to carry on their plans for national aggrandizement
with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carte blanche</i> approval by the
United States. It would mean that we are fighting
at a great sacrifice in order to enable Great
Britain to maintain her position as mistress of
the sea and ruler of a far distant empire. Now
we do not object to British rule in the distant
parts of the earth: we have found it a tolerable
thing that she should be entrusted with the task
of developing the backward races over whom she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
has established her authority. But we have
never meant to save her toppling empire for her
own comfort, as an act of grace merely.</p>

<p>If we are to contribute a material part to the
suppression of aggression in the world, we have
a right to say in what way and to what end our
sacrifice will have been made. As the greatest
of the anti-German allies we shall have the largest
burden to bear in proportion to the time in
which we are to fight. That we should guarantee
to Great Britain and our other allies the
full existence of their rights is but fair. It is
equally reasonable that we shall demand that
the future does not inure to the special advantage
of any one of the group; but in fixing
upon the terms under which it shall be arranged
the main end in view should be the good of all
the nations in the world.</p>

<p>This is a view which is likely to have the support
of all the anti-German allies, with the possible
exception of Britain. France and Russia,
to say nothing of the smaller states, have the
same interest as we in making the common welfare
the chief aim in peace negotiations. If
we were not in the group and if victory came to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
it, these nations would perforce have to yield the
lead to Great Britain, since she would outclass
them in strength by reason of her sea power.
She might well say that as the nation on which
would fall the largest burden in keeping Germany
in a state of restraint, she should have
the largest influence in deciding what was to be
done. She cannot make such a claim under existing
conditions.</p>

<p>Of course, there is the difficulty that the United
States may not be guided by statesmen who realize
the importance of following a thoroughly
American policy. It has long been a practice
with a great many Americans to follow the lead
of Great Britain. Unaccustomed to take a normal
share of responsibility in world problems, we
may now be inclined to hold back, leaving the
game to hands that have acquired greater skill
in playing it. Such a course would be a misfortune.
It would mean that statesmen would be
given charge of the situation who derived all
their ideas under the old system of Balance of
Power, and it would be strange if they did not try
to carry on the world in the future with a strong
squint at the only principles of international<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
policy they know anything about. To break into
this well crystallized realm of so-called practical
ideas, demands an unusually strong man, a man
well founded in principles and able to convince
others of the wisdom of his views.</p>

<p>It is true that the President of the United
States now in office has many of the traits that
seem necessary to a correct conduct of the situation.
A man who had the training of a mere
politician might well be less than able to deal
with the situation that faces us. President Wilson’s
knowledge of history enables him to think
in terms of large national movements. That is
the chief value of historical training to a statesman.
If he knows the history of the attempts to
settle the affairs of the nations after the great
world struggles of the past, he is better able to
understand how the various suggested plans will
work in the crisis that is to be passed through.</p>

<p>President Wilson has, also, the unusual faculty
of doing what he wishes to do. When he has
formed a purpose it is not generally a compromise
with a number of men whose chief concern
is how the result of action will affect their
party support. At least this is true in matters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
not clearly within the bounds of party activity.
Moreover, he has spoken and written words
which seem to show that he understands the need
of providing for such a course of conduct between
the nations as will assure us of coöperation for
the elimination of future wars. In his long delay
in urging war and in his early pronouncement
for a league of peace, he gave us the assurance,
if nothing else, that he understands the situation
and is capable of holding a firm course in
accordance with his principles.</p>

<p>If the submarines fail, therefore, and if we
come to a settlement of the largely new world
problems that will confront us, and if our policy
is in the hands of wise men, what principles will
guide our actions and the actions of the rest
of the world? This is a question that all intelligent
citizens should consider, since it cannot be
answered well unless there is a restrained and
broad-minded public opinion to support the leaders
of the people. It is a matter for the consideration
of Germans as well as their opponents; for
their attitude toward any policy adopted will
have a strong effect upon the continuation of the
policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
The first question we should ask ourselves is:
What are we to do to the Germans? How shall
we punish them for what they have done to make
the world miserable? My answer to that is:
Let God punish them. For us it is not a question
of giving the Germans their deserts but a
question of coming out of this cataclysm with
a clear gain for the cause of human happiness.
Let us look upon the Germans as suffering from
a kind of disease of the mind which produces
bad results on those with whom they are in contact.
It is ours to prescribe a cure, both for
their sake and for ours. I suggest that we first
put them on a liquid diet to reduce their exuberant
vitality and then give them the rest cure.
At any rate, that is better than cropping their
ears or putting them into strait-jackets. To
treat an impassioned man you do not kick and
beat him but try to bring him to his senses. To
bring the Germans into a realization that this
world is run on the principle of live-and-let-live,
we ourselves must show a willingness to let live.</p>

<p>We had a large amount of the opposite spirit
in the United States from 1865 to 1875. The
South, passionately convinced that slavery was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
no evil, had made as good a fight to preserve her
cause as Germany has made or can make. She
held out to the last with what her own people
called a stout heart, but her foes said with a
stiff neck. For a year and a half after the outside
world concluded that she could never win,
she held on in the hope that her adversaries would
tire of war and make peace without victory.
Now all this was exasperating, and the mass of
the Northern people felt in 1865 that some punishment
should be inflicted on the perverse people
who had inflicted so much unnecessary misery on
the country. But Lincoln did not feel that way.
There is no reason to think that he gave a moment’s
thought to making the South suffer for
her course. For him all thought was how to
smooth the wrinkles out of the present, and how
to make the Southern people cast out their hatred
of the union and come back to their former loyalty.
The Lincoln spirit should guide the world
at the end of the present struggle.</p>

<p>War lives on hatred. To make your people
put all their energy into the fight make them
hate the other people; and you may rest in the
assurance that the leaders of the others are striving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
to make their followers hate the men on your
side. The mill of hate grinds steadily and at a
high speed while war lasts. In Germany in these
days is a vast amount of industrious abusing of
England. That makes the German people support
the war. In Great Britain is a great activity
in describing atrocities in Belgium and
Armenia, and it exists in order to make the British
people mad for war. When you see a new
crop of the testimony concerning the torturing
horrors of the first month of war in Belgium,
you may know that the war spirit is running low
in Britain. Unhappily, such propaganda is a
necessary feature of war. We are naturally
good-hearted, and we do not go out to kill men
until we are made to hate them.</p>

<p>The moment war ends all this kind of thing
should cease. The time will then have come for
the propaganda of peace. Unfortunately there
are few men whose mission it is to spread such
ideas. Merchants and tourists may do what is
their nature to do, but they are not sufficient; and
it generally takes years for the fires to cool off.</p>

<p>The aftermath of our civil war was as unhappy
a series of events as we have encountered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
within our national history. Undertaken as a
means of making sure of the gains of the civil
war, it became a procession of passion in which
stalked all the worst feelings that divided the
people in actual warfare. There are still men in
the North who have Andersonville in mind when
they vote, and men in the South who can never
respect the republican party because it was responsible
for the reconstruction acts of 1867. It
will be extremely unfortunate if we take up the
problems that are soon to be upon us in the spirit
with which we assumed the duties of reconstructing
the South.</p>

<p>During the civil war the South was possessed
of a fixed idea: the same thing is true of Germany
today. The South was committed to a
position that the rest of the world had abandoned:
Germany is committed to a type of bureaucratic
government which is as much out of date in a
modern world as slavery. No ordinary system
of reasoning could show fair and honest Southern
men in what respect they had the sentiment of
civilization against them: the German is thoroughly
convinced that he is fighting for the preservation
of the most efficient type of government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
the world has seen. The South went to her defeat
after a long and astonishingly effective resistance:
Germany seems to be destined to a similarly
long and steady process of reduction into
complete prostration. The South was ruled by
a small but able class of landed proprietors who
refused to see the plain truth of the situation
before them and prolonged the struggle until
they were exhausted, although by making a favorable
adjustment in accordance with the logic
of the conditions before them they might have
ended the war in 1864 and saved their people
from the uttermost bitterness of defeat: the Germans,
ruled by their Junkers, are equally deaf
to argument, equally determined to die at their
posts, and equally opposed to a compromise by
which they will have to give up their antiquated
“institution,” relinquish their special privileges,
and make their country like the rest of the world.
There are so many parallels between the two
countries that we wonder if there will not also be
a disposition of the victorious opposing allies to
degrade Germany in her defeat.</p>

<p>Probably her best adjusted punishment will be
the reflection that her “peculiar institution”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
proved a failure in time of need. For a century
she has been training an army, but it is not the
army that has failed her. It has done all that
could have been expected of it. Nor did the
Southern army fail the South. It is not the
sense of loyalty, nor the scientific efficiency, nor
the unity of purpose within the empire, that have
failed her. They are all splendid and have done
what could be demanded of them. The thing
that has failed is the peculiar way in which the
German ruling classes have made use of these
forces. They have used army, scientific efficiency,
loyalty, and unity of purpose to promote
the ends of an aggressive ruling class. Now the
best treatment is to defeat them in the war and
allow them plenty of time, with no unnecessary
antagonisms, to learn that their system does not
pay, and that any attempt to revive it in the
future will be followed by another punishment as
severe as that which this war brought. The support
of a military caste and the training of all the
men in a great army are heavy burdens on the
economic life of the state. Will any nation continue
to bear them if they come to nothing in the
day of trial? Armies for defense do not demand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the great expenditures that Germany has made
in the last decades.</p>

<p>No penalty that the victors could lay on Germany
would be permanently effective in reducing
her. So great are her economic energies that
they would restore her to prosperity within a short
time, and she would be ready to take advantage of
any favorable combination to strike in revenge.
Disarmament would not be a guaranty that she
would cease to be troublesome to her neighbors;
for she would still have her excellently trained
soldiers who could be reassembled in a great army
at short notice. She might well be required to
dismantle her great armament factories; and since
they are essential to the re-arming of a great
army some check on her restoration would come
from such dismantling. But it would be a temporary
check. It is only necessary to remember
that the beginning of the present German army
was the attempt of one conqueror, Napoleon, to
limit the Prussian army to 42,000 men.</p>

<p>Moreover, what nations could be expected to
agree among themselves while standing guard
over Germany? Under the Balance of Power,
we might expect a fair amount of mobility of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
alliances. We have just seen that not even the
Triple Alliance was proof against the skillful
hands of Delcassé. If Italy could be withdrawn
by France from that powerful combination, how
can we doubt that a humiliated Germany would
find means of weakening the combination against
her? She would have the greatest inducement
to do so; and it is not probable that complete harmony
would prevail long between the victors, if
they were held together only by the bonds of
mutual friendship. The history of diplomacy is
the record of broken friendships.</p>

<p>To see what readjustment might occur with
respect to a humiliated Germany, it is only necessary
to recall the position of France after the
Napoleonic wars. Beaten beyond resistance,
suspected of carrying the germs of bad government
from which all other nations felt that they
must be protected as from deadly disease, and
held down by great armies of occupation, her situation
would seem to have been most deplorable.
But her isolation lasted for only a moment. She
was admitted to the Congress of Vienna,&mdash;called
to pass on the future arrangements of Europe,&mdash;because
there was division among her conquerors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
From that time she was suspected less and
less, and at the Conference of Aix-la-Chapelle,
1818, she was admitted to the Concert of Europe,
but not with full fellowship; for the other powers
made a secret agreement to watch her for a while
longer. She progressed so rapidly in eliminating
the republican virus in her system that in
1823 she was entrusted with the task of suppressing
the constitution of Spain. Thus in eight
years after the battle of Waterloo France was
again in full accord with the other powers.
Probably few people would have said in 1815 that
her restoration would come about so rapidly. It
would be no more singular if within ten years
after the end of the present struggle a conquered
Germany were to forget her antipathies of 1918
and be ready to give and be given in diplomatic
alliances with as little regard for the past.</p>

<p>If, for example, a restored and highly nationalized
Russia becomes a threat against Western
Europe some years hence, the antagonisms of
today would be forgotten and Germany, France,
and Great Britain would probably be found
fighting side by side to restrain the Muscovite
giant. The old system is intensely selfish and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
lends itself to rapid changes in policies. But it
is an expensive thing to keep up the system.
Large armies are necessary, great debts are
created, and a vast amount of nervous strength is
diverted from the normal activities of humanity.
It is small hope for him who longs to see war put
down permanently that only by fighting a war
like that now raging may we expect the nations
to defeat any future aspirant for universal
power.</p>

<p>Finally, if the submarines fail and the anti-German
allies break down the defenses of their
enemies and thus are able to determine the kind
of peace that is to be made, the treaty of peace
should not have for its end the prolongation of
the power of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> group. The history of
the first half of the nineteenth century shows how
easy it is for such a group to be re-arranged
with the result that new wars threaten. We
must trust the fair mindedness of human nature
and the logic of the situation to do much for the
Germans. It is on their acceptance of the issue
that we must rest our hopes for a peaceful future.</p>

<p>These truths are especially pertinent to the interests
of the United States. We are not fighting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Europe’s war, but the world’s. We are the
only nation in the struggle that has not a special
interest at stake. We are the only member of
our group of allies that has a right to take the
side of the weakest member of that group against
the desire of the strongest. If any one member
should in a moment of more or less pardonable
forgetfulness of the common good advance
claims that would be based on a desire to recoup
herself for her sufferings, we best of all could
demand equal treatment and see that the seed of
future discord are not sown. These are principles
that every American citizen should understand.</p>

<span class="subhead">OBSTACLES TO AN ENDURING PEACE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>By an enduring peace I mean a peace that
shall last as long as we can see into the future.
It is such a peace as has in it, so far as we can see,
no fact that would seem to make for its ruin. If
we adopt a peace that has the seed of destruction
in its very nature, we cannot hope for relief from
the evils of war. We must, under such a condition,
take account of war as one of the permanent
burdens of civilization, with the full consciousness
that it will become increasingly expensive in
life and property, and with the result that at recurring
periods an intelligent world will drop its
peaceful tasks to try to reduce its population to
a nullity. From the possibility of such a strife
we turn to ask the question: “Can nothing be
done to save humanity from such madness?”</p>

<p>The answer is very simple: All people are
unreasonable to some extent. In connection
with the question now under consideration, each
of the great states of the world, our own included,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
has its own special form of unreasonableness,
which acts as an obstacle to the formation
of a régime of peace. If the immense disaster
by which we are depressed could serve as a means
of bringing us to a state of entire reasonableness,
the present war would be worth all it costs.
Whether or not it can lead to such a result the
reader must determine for himself.</p>

<p>An important obstacle to such a result is the
economic competition of nations. Economic
competition by individuals has ugly sides, but it
is not dangerous in the sense in which national
competition is dangerous. When two merchants
undersell until one breaks down the business of
the other, the victim passes out of sight in the
business world, and the current of trade soon goes
on as before. When two corporations, however
great, engage in a business “war” and one is
crushed or absorbed by its competitor, the ripple
that was made is soon obliterated, and the victor
serves the human wants with which it has to do
without serious damage to humanity.</p>

<p>But when one nation finds itself in strong competition
with another in the hope of controlling a
sphere of trade, it is apt to seek territorial annexation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
to gain the desired field of exploitation.
The competitor can only follow the same course.
It is the only thing it can do, if it is not willing to
give up the contest. If it is strong enough to dispute
the will of the rival, its very sense of individuality
demands that it shall not tamely yield before
the aggression of a rival. When France
acquired Morocco, Italy acquired Tripoli, and
Great Britain acquired the southern part of
Persia, economic advantage was a strong motive,
but not the only motive. When Germany laid
out the field of her future expansion in Turkish
lands and when she expected to establish a permanent
influence over the Balkans, the extension
of her sphere of commerce was a chief motive.</p>

<p>Probably the fundamental wrong here was
the idea, widely held by the present generation,
that a nation has a right to establish bars around
her national territory to keep the trade of other
nations out, so that her own citizens shall have
preferential advantages in the exploitation of the
territory. That idea is so firmly held today
that one must be a rash man who attempts to get
the nations to give it up. But it is a fundamental
obstacle to permanent peace in the world. Probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
it is not too much to say that as long as the
business men of the world insist on dividing
themselves into national groups with these
national preferences, so long may they expect
business at recurring intervals to be burdened
with the waste and ruin of war.</p>

<p>Against the existing practice we may place the
“open door” policy, which we have known chiefly
in connection with the trade of the undeveloped
nations. It means the free opening of the trade
of a given state to all the nations that may care
to have it. We heard much of the “open door”
in China a few years ago, and most of the benevolent
governments approved of the suggestion.
To have been perfectly logical they should have
applied the same idea to their own commerce;
and if the world ever comes to a perfect state of
international comity, it is likely that national
tariff barriers will be broken down.</p>

<p>It is true, however, that we can have enduring
peace and have national protective tariffs, also.
If nations agree that tariffs are one of the unhappy
excrescences of an unreasonable world,
they may find it in their hearts to tolerate such
growths. To tolerate them would be, no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
better than going to war. But when a state sets
its eyes on a certain part of the earth which it
feels it must acquire in order to enlarge the territory
in which it can trade without fair competition,
the peace of the world is imperiled.</p>

<p>It is probable that this kind of motive played
a large part in Germany’s decision to begin the
present war. For a long time her industries
had been developing at a rapid rate. Protected
at home by tariffs they were able to sell goods
to the German people at high prices, while they
sold at cheap prices in foreign markets in order
to drive their competitors away. The volume of
German trade increased immensely, factories
were multiplied, and large credits were extended
by the banks in order to support this great
structure. At last the situation became unsteady.
The expansion of the foreign part of the
national trade at small profits was a clog on the
home trade, which could not be made to yield
enough profit to keep the business of the country
in a healthy condition. Then the manufacturers
and capitalists came to the conclusion that it was
to their interest for the country to go into a war
of conquest in which new national territory should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
be laid at their feet for profitable exploitation.
Thus, the large business interests, usually supporters
of peace, swung to the support of the militarists.
It is significant that the liberals, that
party in the Reichstag which speaks especially for
the traders, capitalists, and manufacturers, have
been among the most outspoken advocates of annexation.</p>

<p>In a powerful, if indirect, way the laborers
are reached by this argument. They see that if
the manufacturers and transportation companies
expand their business wages are better and employment
more abundant, and this leads them
to favor a policy of expansion. To what extent
the remote organs of the business world are thus
reached it is difficult to say. But it is evident
that in a phase of human activity which has been
organized most intricately the influence of the initial
idea that a war of annexation helps business
is far reaching.</p>

<p>We frequently encounter the assertion that
economic laws are unchangeable; but the statement
is not true, as it is made. Many economic
processes that appeared fundamental in their
time have changed as the minds of men have taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
new grips on human life. The world has outgrown
the mercantile school of economic ideas.
The attitude toward private property and
monopolies, and the view of the right of individual
bargaining have been greatly modified in the
process of time. If a so-called economic law
stands in the way of a reasonable adjustment of
human relations, it can be altered, if enough time
and effort be given to the attempt to change it.
Although it may seem to be fundamentally fixed
in the minds of business men and laborers that
a war for annexation is in their interests, if reason
shows that they are mistaken, there should
be a way of bringing reason to their minds, even
as it has come to ours.</p>

<p>Another obstacle to enduring peace is a false
sense of patriotism. If a man extols his own virtues
we say he is a boaster: if he extols the good
qualities of his town, state, or nation, we say he
is a patriot. I am inclined to say that it is not
permitted to a man to praise his country&mdash;I do
not say love his country&mdash;in any sense but that in
which he may praise himself, modestly and with
reservations. At any rate, he should praise and
magnify his country in the most restrained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
spirit possible. Patriotism does not demand
national egotism in the good citizen. Those
writers and teachers who try to create a national
spirit should be careful lest they make men mere
chauvinists.</p>

<p>Especially perilous is the doctrine that “self-preservation
is the first law of nature” as applied
to nations. Times come when a man is not justified
in preserving his life. So to nations come
crises in which they are not permitted by the rules
of morality to save themselves by what appear to
be the only means left. In the present war Germany
asserted that she was justified by this principle
in adopting the ruthless war of the submarine,
since it was the only thing that would
save her from destruction. It is better for a
state to go to destruction, just as it is better for
a man to go to his death, with clean hands than
to live foully.</p>

<p>It is but an extension of this doctrine for men
of normal morality to say they may do things
for the benefit of the state which they may not
do for their own benefit. A statesman has no
more right to make his state steal another state’s
lands than he has to take his neighbor’s watch.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
It is not a virtue if he lies for his state. The
state cannot speak of itself: it speaks through its
agents. It is sullied, even as a man is sullied in
his character, when its only voice, the words and
acts of its servants, is not true. Judged by the
standards here set up, the world’s diplomacy
needs amendment, and if amended one of the
obstacles to peace will be removed.</p>

<p>A false sense of patriotism may lead to acts
that imperil peace. When France acquired Morocco
her object was not wholly to extend her
economic interests. To increase the national
strength was also a motive. Likewise, Germany’s
desire to establish control over the territory
southeast of her was not entirely economic
in its origin. She also wished to increase the
glory and strength of the Fatherland. How
much we are to condemn this desire of a citizen
for the glory of his country it is hard to say; but
it seems to be clear that such a desire may manifest
itself in such a way as to become a serious
obstacle to peace.</p>

<p>At the end of the present war the victorious
nations will be in a position to abate national
glory in the interest of enduring peace. Our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
own citizens are supposed to be particularly
proud of the achievements of the United States.
If our efforts should contribute as much as we
wish to the triumph of our own side, we should
be careful lest we forget that we entered the
war with the modest purpose of making the world
a fit place of habitation for <em>all</em> people. Likewise
we should be justified in using our influence
among our allies to see that the desire of no
statesman to enhance the glory of his nation leads
to action which may imperil peace in the future.
When we shall have fought long and suffered
greatly our hearts are likely to become harder
than now, in the beginning of the war; and there
is danger that we shall forget early resolutions
if we are not firmly committed to them at the
outset.</p>

<p>Another obstacle to enduring peace is the sense
of nationality. The older men of this generation
who were students in Germany in their youth
acquired much respect for the passionate desire
of Germans to build up unity among all German
speaking people. It was a sacred idea to young
men and imaginative writers. Long had North
Germany been disunited, stumbling forward under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
the lead of the Hapsburgs. To be able to
form a dominating group among all the Germans
in the world seemed no more than was their just
due. We did not realize in those days to what
an end these people who lost so many opportunities
through internal weakness would put their
strength when they had at last developed it.
And yet, it was the right of the Germans to unite
themselves into as strong a nation as they might
form. The wrong came in the improper extension
of the idea. When men like Treitschke talk
about including Holland in the German Fatherland
we may well ask where nationality’s pretensions
are taking us?</p>

<p>It was natural, also, that the sense of nationality
should be manifested in many other European
countries. Each of the Balkan states had its
own phase of it. Russia had a large hope of
uniting in her control all the peoples of Slavic
blood. Italy demanded Trieste as a part of the
Italian-speaking world. Greece lived for the
acquisition of Macedonia and the Greek Islands,
and France never diminished her pathetic longing
for Alsace-Lorraine, where lived French-speaking
peoples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Often the desire for nationality runs directly
counter to economic laws. For example, what
are we to do when we have Austria holding on
to her only great Adriatic seaport as the essential
outlet of her trade to the sea, and nationality
proclaiming that this port shall be handed
over to Italy? Moreover, different peoples are
so intermixed in some parts of Europe that it is
impossible for any but a scientific specialist to
say which states, or sections of states, are occupied
by a majority of one race and which by
a majority of another. If we are to set out to
divide Europe according to nationality we shall
have a large task on our hands. In the United
States the principle of nationality is not to be
pleaded, since we are so intimately intermixed
that it would be hopeless to try to range us into
racial groups. Moreover, we get along very well
as it is, having once agreed that we shall have to
get along together. Perhaps if the nationalizing
propaganda ceased in Europe race antagonism
would subside.</p>

<p>Autocratic classes in society constitute still another
obstacle to peace. We have heard much on
this subject of late, and some of the things that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
have been said have been so ill-established in truth
that they must make the real autocrats smile. It
will probably help us to understand the situation
if we undertake to enumerate the good things an
autocracy can do. For truth never profits by
falsehood, and the most autocratic people in the
world have sense enough to know when they are
misrepresented.</p>

<p>Let us remember that under favorable conditions
an autocracy is composed of the more capable
people in the community in which it exists.
They are more capable because they have been
brought up most carefully, that is, because they
have the best trained minds. There is no law of
nature by which more fools are born in an aristocracy
than in a proletariat. In fact, the tendency
is the other way; for since the aristocrats
are in a position to cultivate themselves in a given
generation, it is natural that a comparatively
large portion of their children shall be well endowed
mentally. To this gift of nature add the
influence of better educational training, and you
see how natural it is to expect an autocracy to be
stronger mentally than those who would have to
replace it if it were overthrown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Again, an autocracy is not necessarily unpatriotic.
Of course, it has its own idea of what
patriotism is, but so have the classes below the
autocracy. Its patriotism usually embraces an
honestly held opinion that the autocratic state is
the best form of society. On this basis it is willing
to sacrifice much for the state. We see it
putting “lives, fortunes, and sacred honor” literally
at the entire command of the state. No
man can do more than give his all for that which
he holds right.</p>

<p>An autocracy may be composed of men of the
best private manners and principles. They frequently
include the best poets, historians, novelists,
philosophers, and teachers of the nation. It
is they who encourage art, and set standards of
taste in architecture, landscape gardening, and
general culture. Compared with the leisure class
of a prosperous industrial country they may be
more courteous, more unassuming, and less given
to offensive use of their wealth. They are the
kind of men whom any of us could love if we
knew them personally. These words do not, of
course, apply to all members of the class, but to
the group as a whole in ordinary conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Of the German autocracy most of these things
can be said, and more. It is a hard working
group and generally speaking it is honest. In
the service of the state it has a record of efficient
government that few democratic countries can
show. The officials of German towns and cities,
provinces and states, taken from the hereditary
upper classes, are well trained, faithful, and free
from the suggestion of corruption. It will take
New York or Chicago many years to develop
the state of good government that exists in Berlin.
Moreover, the German autocracy has the
respect of the German people.</p>

<p>Up to last winter the Russian autocracy was
an obstacle to peace. Many who looked forward
to a reign of reason wondered how they were going
to make the theory work while the largest
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entente</i> nation was in the hands of an autocracy
that was less tolerable than the German autocracy.
Fortunately, fate has settled the question,
for the time at least. So uncertain is the condition
of affairs in Russia, that no one can say what
will be the outcome. It is by no means certain
that the peasants, workers, and soldiers, will not
make actual war against the former autocrats,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
leading to a state of chaos like the worst phases
of the French Revolution. If such a thing happens,
a reaction in favor of the former ruling
class may well follow. If the war ends before
the newly established government is firmly
seated in power some such upheaval may be
expected. Certainly the time of danger is not
yet passed.</p>

<p>The German autocracy is better than that
which ruled Russia. In fact, it would be less
dangerous if it were less serviceable. Its sins are
not the patent sins of peculation, cruelty, laziness,
or despotism. It offends in that it takes
away the confidence of nation in nation. It offends
because it is filled with unfortunate purposes.
It is possible to think of an autocracy
that would be no menace for the peace of the
world, an autocracy filled with no ambition for
world conquest. It is true that most autocratic
governments have not been of this kind, and they
seem militarists by nature, whence arise the ideals
with which they trouble the world.</p>

<p>When Hegel preached the philosophy of war
that underlies the German’s devotion to
war, he was largely right from the Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
standpoint. He held that the mind becomes
sluggish through inactivity and that war burns
up its waste matter and leads to energy of character.
This doctrine would not be essentially
true in any normally organized society; for there
are as many opportunities for self-expression in
commerce, finance, manufactures, art, and other
peaceful occupations as in war. But a century
ago Prussia was filled, even more than today, with
a mass of small nobles, unaccustomed to any ordinary
form of labor, and with slender incomes.
They were just the class that would fall into the
effete vices of an aristocracy. To them the military
life was an avenue of steady and moral employment.
They took places in the great machine,
and by 1870 they had been bred into its
very spirit. The process saved the German
nobles from vapidity. At the same time, as
a class, they preserved their political privileges,
and it has happened that they, with their official
heads, the kaiser, kings, and princes, have been
able to unite political power and military purposes
until they have made of their country the
most military state of modern times. If Germany
has fought the present war with great ability,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
it is the organized autocracy that deserves the
credit.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, the union of the political and
military power in the hands of a privileged class
in Germany that now constitutes the greatest
obstacle to peace. It enables a small and efficient
portion of the German population to wield the
rest of the people for the ends they have decided
are best. If this union of functions could be
broken up, and if political power could be distributed
as in the countries governed by the people,
the obstacle would be reduced in size. It is
not necessary to suppose that it would be removed
altogether; for even if equal suffrage were
established in Germany, and if autocracy were
shorn of its preponderating electoral power,
the nobles would still be the most capable class in
the empire. Their personality would go a long
way in perpetuating their influence. If they
played the game of trying to lead the people
they might remain rulers of Germany for a long
time after losing their present electoral advantages.</p>

<p>It is fair to assume that a democracy will be
less likely to go to war than an autocracy. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the middle and lower classes that bear the chief
burdens of war. They fight for no promotions.
Generally the happiest thing that can come to one
of them is a disabling wound to send him home
with his head safely on his shoulders. Kings and
their sons are rarely killed in battle. When this
war began the kaiser was one of the proud Germans
who had five tall sons of military age.
After nearly four years of fighting none of them
have been seriously injured. It would be interesting
to know if there is another German father
of five sons who has been so gently treated by fortune.
Report says that fifty thousand schoolmasters
were killed in Germany during the first
two years of the war. It would be interesting to
learn whether or not the titled class has given up
so large a proportion of its members for the cause
of the Fatherland.</p>

<p>And yet, it must not be thought that wars cannot
exist in democratic countries. When Rome
was a republic war was a constant thing. Athens
in her republican days had many wars. In the
region that is now the United States of America
have been several wars. The war for independence
was essentially popular. It was organized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
by that part of the population which resented
British aristocratic institutions, the class we
should today call “the plain people.” In the civil
war the demand that slavery be destroyed did not
come from the wealthy men of the North, the
class that stood for the American aristocracy, but
from the middle classes, men who filled the
churches and who followed the common impulses
of the heart. It was resisted by the South, as
democratically organized as Germany would be
with the Junkers turned out of power, and the
struggle was as bitter as any the world had
seen up to the fatal year 1914. Democratic
states can fight, and they do fight, but they are
less likely to go to war than autocratic states.</p>

<p>If it seems to any of us a necessary thing that
autocracy must be removed from the earth, it is
well to remember that autocracy can be removed
only through the operation of a long and slow
process. It can be reduced by some great catastrophe,
but it cannot be smitten out in a day.
Take away its political power, and perhaps its
financial power will be left. Undermine that by
raising up a rich bourgeoisie, and its social influence
will perhaps still exist. You do not abolish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
it by decree; you banish it only when you have
substituted a better thing.</p>

<p>What force exists in Germany with which the
autocracy can be supplanted? Next to the radicals,
a small faction at best, we have the socialists,
numerous enough to have great influence,
but committed to a theory of society which cannot
be established until humanity has gone
through centuries of development in the principles
of equality. Then we find the national liberals,
whose name is likely to mislead liberals in
other parts of the world. They would be called
the stand-pat, capitalistic portion of society in
the United States, men who believe first of all in
the protection of their large interests. In the
present struggle they are committed to the Pan-Germany
policy since it means the expansion of
markets for German wares. Next come the centrists,
Catholics in their primary interests, and
fundamentally opposed to the doctrines for which
the socialists stand. Finally we come to the conservatives,
who believe in the autocracy. What
magician can fuse these parties into a solid movement
for the establishment of really parliamentary
government?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Last obstacle of all that I shall mention here
is the accumulated machinery of war that has
been built up in modern states. I do not refer
to ideas but to materials and men. Much has
been written to show that munition makers have
deliberately fostered a belief in war, so as to make
a market for their products. Probably some exaggeration
exists in most of these arguments
and statements. The Krupps and their brethren
have plausible grounds for saying that war is
inevitable, and that they serve it but do not promote
it. But giving them as much benefit of the
doubt as they can expect, it must be true that
their very existence, and their fine application of
science to their business, have led states to count
on war as a matter of course. These great aggregations
of capital have vast influence in political
circles. They have so many stockholders that
they affect a large number of influential men.
So much are they committed to the cause in which
their fortunes and hearts are enlisted that they
ought not to have the opportunity to wield their
peculiar influence. When this war is over, it
would be a real service if every munitions factory
as such were taken into government hands and its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
capital stock closed out as a business enterprise.
It is only the state, and the state in the hands of
the people, that can safely be trusted with this
powerful weapon for the creation of war sentiment.</p>

<p>The professional soldiers are also a part of the
war machinery which stands in the way of an
enduring peace. They can hardly be expected to
become pacifists. They are trained to regard
war as a necessity. All their ideas of virtue are
wrapped up in the fine qualities of a brave soldier.
Any other standard is strange to them. They
may be expected to throw all their weight of influence
in favor of recurring wars. Not that
they wish wars to recur, but that they consider
it improper to contemplate anything else in the
natural order of events. This is a hard problem
to deal with. A few professional soldiers may be
brought to set their faces against war; but as to
the great majority, I fear that those who try to
abolish war will have to count on the opposition
of the professional warriors until the end of the
chapter.</p>

<p>This array of obstacles to enduring peace, is it
not formidable? Economic competition, the actual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
if false sense of patriotism, the desire for
nationality&mdash;which is liable to run into extreme
assertions and sometimes to run counter to the
strongest economic interests&mdash;the existence of
autocratic government, and the powerful influence
of munition makers and professional warriors&mdash;these
are some of the obstacles against
which those must contend who try to convince
the world that peace is the better way. They
may well appal the stoutest hearted friend of enduring
peace.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="subhead">ARGUMENTS FOR A FEDERATION OF STATES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The arguments against attempting to establish
an enduring peace are undoubtedly formidable,
but they do not leave the idealist entirely
vanquished. On his side fight humanity and
reason, and it is his function to stand by humanity
and reason. He has long ago formed the habit
of attacking obstacles. In this case the objections
he meets are all rooted in the opinions of
men, and he loves to change opinions, or, if he
does not change them, to hammer away at them
as long as life lasts. For his fine optimism we
can but have great respect, and in this chapter I
intend to summarize his arguments and give them
to the public in as strong a light of plausibility
as possible. If the stolid opposition of the
“practical” world is not to be broken down, let it
be shaken as much as may be. The time of its
defeat is written in the book of fate. It may be
that the time is near at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
In the first place, let me recall a statement
made in the preceding chapter. To get any
desired reform adopted and carried out, it is
first necessary to get the people to imagine the
reform in operation. I mean that they must
have a clear mental picture of themselves living
contentedly under the proposed plan. Let the
proposition be made in such a way that the effective
people who direct the government can not, or
will not, in the mind’s eye see it in operation, and
it will surely fail. Let them imagine its successful
use and they will most likely find it unobjectionable.
Likewise, if the people of the world
could imagine a great coöperative union to promote
peace, with enough force behind it to enforce
the will of the union, if in their minds they could
see themselves adjusted into such a system, with
all its economy in taxes, human suffering, and
ordinary governmental effort, it would not be
very difficult to make such a scheme work in
actual experience.</p>

<p>The “practical” man has but little imagination.
He has to be deceived into the acceptance
of reforms. Make him believe that a given plan
has been made to work and his objections are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
diminished, if not overcome altogether. This is
not said for scolding but as a sober fact confronting
the man who reasons his way through matters
that perplex him. The “practical” man is not
responsible for his weakness, and he is in the majority
among men. On the other hand, the man
with imagination is not to be faint-hearted. If
he can see and talk, he may, by reiteration finally
make his brothers see also.</p>

<p>Fundamentally his position rests upon the reasonableness
of his proposition: war is madness,
brutality, useless waste of wealth and life, and the
negation of civilization. It proceeds from the
unnecessarily irritated state of the public mind.
Reason demands that she be allowed to have an
opportunity to exert her influence in a reasonable
world over reasonable beings. Since law is the
expression of the will of reasonable beings, let law
be given the supervision of all the disputes which
may possibly lead to war. How true all this
sounds! And the preacher of peace says boldly
that it is more worth while to plan, spend money,
and take a chance in a great world effort to bring
such a reasonable situation to pass than to go on
planning, spending, and risking things in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
efforts to make a system work that has ever led
us around in a circle to the same old end, war and
misery.</p>

<p>The advocate of peace points to the duel.
There was a time when every man felt it his right
and duty to settle his own quarrels. He was his
own judge and his own sheriff. The result was
so bad that law was created to enforce peace between
individuals. The old condition survived
in the duel, but in most countries this at last was
brought under the authority of law. Private
combat in its nature does not differ from public
combat, and if one was eliminated by the creation
of a law that was strong enough to forbid it, the
other can be abolished by creating a still stronger
law, powerful enough to restrain states as criminal
law restrains individuals.</p>

<p>Kant’s argument for perpetual peace ran like
this, but he, in sympathy with Rousseau’s social
contract theory, argued that the law that restrained
individuals was the result of agreement
between individuals; and he went further and
argued that all that was necessary to secure perpetual
peace would be for the states to agree to
establish a league, or a federation, to enforce it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Now there was a fallacy in Kant’s argument that
has a bearing on the subject immediately before
us today. There is no reason to suppose that any
state ever arose from an agreement of individuals.
The ordinary process was growth out of
several conditions. An enlarged family might
become a state, or one tribe might conquer another
and enlarge itself into a state. Kinship
and force were probably the chief causes in producing
the state; and reason seems to have played
a small part. Similarly, law grew up, not as the
result of reason, but as a body of tribal customs,
reasonably interpreted by the wise men of the
early state.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, no analogy between the
proposed method of forming a great super-state
with its own body of law, the object of which is to
restrain the states from going to war, and the
method by which the early state was created. In
fact, if one great nation were to conquer the rest
of the world and impose its peace on all the world,
as it would do, we should have a process more
analogous to the origin of the early state. And
that is one way of having peace. Within the
last years it has seemed a horribly possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
method; for if Mittel-Europa becomes a fact, it
will have such predominating power that it is
difficult to see what will stop its march to general
authority.</p>

<p>Pointing out Kant’s fallacy weakens his argument
as such, but it leaves us in such a dilemma
that we are prone to pronounce his suggestion
worth trying as an escape from conquest by one
great power. For if the world is tending toward
unity through conquest, who can doubt that it
would be better to anticipate the process, save a
great sum of human suffering, and by agreement
found the world federation which is the same
result to which ages of war will lead us. That
we could have such a super-state by contract is
not to be doubted. It would be as possible as the
creation of the United States of America by
agreement.</p>

<p>Another argument of the peace advocate is that
the old system by which the world was kept in
equilibrium, the balance of power, has broken
down, and cannot be trusted to preserve the peace
of the future. Its chief characteristic was that
several states mutually checked one another. If
one manifested an intention that was alarming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
to the rest they combined to restrict the action of
the aggressor. The several states were with regard
to one another in a condition mobile enough
to permit any state to shift from one side to another
as the situation demanded. Now this condition
no longer exists. There has developed a
mid-continental alliance, apparently expecting
to continue to act as one state for practical
purposes, which in itself threatens to dominate
Europe. To hold it in check calls forth all the
united force of the other states and then success is
obtained only through the greatest amount of
preparedness. Such a condition is anything but
the old system which was to work through balance
and concert of action.</p>

<p>The central position of the Germans and Austrians
gives them an immense advantage, if the
world is to go on in its national rivalries. On the
west lie the two nations who are today doing most
to hold them in restraint, France and Great Britain.
The former could never stand against Germany
alone, and the latter is remote enough from
the German frontier to make it improbable that
her forces could reach that spot in time to prevent
the Germans from gaining the initial advantage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
which, in a state of efficient preparation is the
only military success that either side can hope
to win. In the face of a strong and threatening
Germany it would be very likely that these two
nations would have to make a more than formal
alliance. Even if that happened, it is possible
that Germany would construe it as a threat and
begin war.</p>

<p>The only other strong check on the central
powers is Russia, now in a sad state of change.
What her future is going to be is still problematic.
It is a stupendous task for so large a nation,
composed of landlords and peasants for the
most part, to pass from an autocracy to a self-governing
nation. It took France, a smaller
country, from 1789 to 1879 to pass through the
various changes and counter-changes by which
she reformed her government into a republic. It
is safe to say that in the Russian development
the changes will come more rapidly, but it is not
impossible that in this country a period of prolonged
unrest is ahead. Under such circumstances
Russia could hardly be counted on to give
much aid to the Western nations who wished to
restrain Germany. In fact, so fluid would be the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
state of her society that she might well become
the victim of German ambition and contribute
valuable parts of her empire to swell the resources
of her aggressive western neighbors.</p>

<p>One insecure spot must be pointed out in this
argument. It is the continuous close alliance of
Germany and Austria-Hungary. If that breaks
down the whole argument fails. At the present
time it is impossible to say what may happen in
this respect. Much will depend on the new emperor
of the Dual Empire. That he has a very
difficult problem before him is without question.
On one hand is the intense Hungarian
aversion to absorption by Germany, on the other
the passionate desire for union by the German
people in the Dual Empire. It is supposed that
the emperor does not favor absorption; but it
seems certain that he is not able at this time to
take an open stand against it.</p>

<p>The strong part Germany has taken in saving
Austria from Russia gives Germany a firm hold
over the imagination of the Austrian people. It
is possible that financial aid has also been extended
to such an amount that Austria would be
embarrassed if called on to pay back. Nor is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
kaiser in Berlin in a mood to brook defiance from
Vienna. If, therefore Kaiser Karl wishes to be
free of his too intimate dependence on Kaiser
Wilhelm, he will find it to his advantage to conceal
his desire for the time being. It is probable
that we shall not know the present true state of
feelings in Austria for several years after the
war. But unless she is very well Germanized, it
would seem that she must soon realize that she is
playing a losing game in the combined movement.
The real advantages of this war, if any are obtained,
are German advantages. It is German
trade, German <em xml:lang="de" lang="de">kultur</em>, and German prestige that
are being enhanced by the war. Austria as Austria
is not reaping advantages commensurate
with the gains of her greater partner.</p>

<p>The financial argument seems to be much on
the side of the peace advocate. Let us consider
the situation in which the European states will
find themselves after the return of peace. Bankruptcy
is a relative term, if we so interpret it.
That is to say, if the people are willing to bear
patiently their great burdens they will bear them,
and the debts that have been acquired will be
shouldered. If one nation repudiates this debt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
or scales it down, it is probable that the others
will do the same, since to continue to carry the
debt would leave the faithful nation at a disadvantage
with the other nations in reference to
future struggles with one another.</p>

<p>No one knows as yet just who owns the bonds
in the several nations. From Germany we hear
that they are widely held. It is the policy of the
government of any nation to distribute a heavy
debt as widely as possible; and we have in recent
history instances of great patriotism in assuming
debts of this kind. Now it is fair to say that
the more widely the debt is distributed, the
greater its likelihood of permanency. The
larger the number of poor people who own it, the
harder it will be to lessen the burden of the nation.
It follows that in this case the immense
interest charge is likely to persist as a permanent
encumbrance on the economic life of the country.</p>

<p>On the other hand, let us say that it turns out
that the debt is not very widely distributed after
all, or that after the war it follows the course of
most national debts and passes into the hands of
the rich. Then we have the situation likely to
promote class friction. The taxes necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
pay the interest will fall on the mass of people,
who will probably come to believe that they are
taxed for the benefit of the wealthy. Class jealousy
will lead to suggestions of repudiation.
Such a course is more than ordinarily easy in
Germany, France, and Russia, where there are
well organized socialist parties, already keenly
suspicious of the capitalists.</p>

<p>Thus, whether the debt is widely distributed or
not, it contains a menace to society. In one case
it constitutes such a burden that it absorbs the
financial strength of the government. In the
other it invites the most formidable struggle of
the poor against the rich that the world has seen
in a century.</p>

<p>Such a situation is bad enough in itself, but it
does not directly affect the question of peace, our
main consideration at this time; for the debt will
exist as a result of the war, and nothing in the
view of the friends of peace can prevent it. But
through whichever of the two contingent courses
it goes, the state will have difficulty in continuing
the old system.</p>

<p>Let us say that we have a permanent great
debt with a huge interest fund, and the state<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
wishes to add to the taxes in order to keep up its
measures of preparedness. The result must be
to produce uneasiness in the minds of the taxpayers.
In Germany, for example, the interest
charge and the provision for pensions on account
of the present war will probably be considerably
more than a billion dollars a year. Added to the
ordinary expenses of government it will make a
burden more than double that of 1913. Can the
government go on providing armaments, that
may lead to another war, without jeopardizing
the loans that are already issued? In the face of
such heavy taxation it would not be surprising
if the people sold their holdings of bonds to the
capitalists and later turned toward repudiation.
On the other hand, it would be to the interest of
the capitalists to favor moderate expenditures
for armaments and armies, lest the patience of the
people under their burdens might be exhausted.</p>

<p>But suppose the debt was not distributed
widely in the first place, and suppose it was repudiated
after a class struggle, or for any other
reason scaled down. The result would be a severe
blow to credit, and in the future it might
be so difficult to raise funds that war could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
be carried on. No nation can afford to contemplate
war if it has not borrowing capacity. If
the debts of one war are repudiated those of another
may also be repudiated. It behooves the
capitalists, therefore, to support a policy which
will make armed conflict impossible. While
bonds benefit the banker when issued up to a certain
point, they can in some conditions become
his most serious difficulty. So many perils await
the capitalist from a renewal of struggles like the
present, that it is not too much to count upon
him as a supporter of peace until the financial
situation in Europe shall become better than it
will be for many a day. It is his true interest to
support a federated peace, which will tend to
make his bonds secure.</p>

<p>As to the influence of autocracy, the advocate
of peace must admit that it is by nature hostile
to his system of coöperative peace. Such coöperation
must depend on mutual confidence and
trust between nations; and it is natural for distrust
to exist between republican and autocratic
states. The whole trend of autocracy is to self-assertion.
As it exists in Germany today it
could hardly be relied on to take its place in any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
union of states which would involve the subordination
of individual national interests to the common
good.</p>

<p>Granting this, the advocate of peace can assert
that Germany must eventually give up autocracy.
As the only great nations that hold to this
relic of a departed age Germany and Austria-Hungary
are becoming anachronisms. They are
set against the spirit of the twentieth century.
If they tide over the crisis that now confronts
them they will encounter more furious storms at
a later time, and eventually autocracy must be
broken down. The argument rests on faith in
progress. It is the result of confidence in the innate
qualities of human nature. So many times
in the past ages have the people risen against
bad government, that it is safe to say they will
repeat the process until all inequality shall have
been reduced.</p>

<p>German autocracy, a survival of a past century,
exists only because it takes for its object
the good government of a parliamentary system.
In intelligence and honesty it is not like the ancient
system. The resemblance is only in forms.
The republican says: “I will give the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
just, intelligent, and honest government.” The
German autocrat says: “I will do all these
things”; and he redeems his promise. His
brother of the eighteenth century had no such
purpose, being so certain of his position that he
did not have to promise the people anything.
The German autocrat lives in fear of an overthrow.
Perhaps some day he will make a slip&mdash;it
may be from the action of an unwise emperor
or a selfish party clique&mdash;and away will go the
whole system.</p>

<p>Last summer a crisis arose in Berlin. The
very life of the autocracy seemed about to be
taken. It was saved finally by a narrow margin,
and with the making of promises which seem
a long step forward. The people were assured
that such was their meaning. If the promises are
broken, there will be a reckoning. It may be
said that there will never again be so good an
opportunity to force the granting of parliamentary
reforms. That statement is contestable.
The autocracy needs the support of the people at
present, in order to bring Germany through the
crisis that has arisen from the action of the
autocracy, and it may seem from that standpoint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
that the people never had and will never have an
equally good opportunity to strike a blow. But
the call of patriotism is strong in Germany, and
if the liberally minded persons were to stand deliberately
for the defeat of the war credits unless
they were given the reforms they demanded, it is
doubtful if the people would support them. It is
hard to carry a country through a great political
revolution while the very life of the country is
threatened.</p>

<p>After war comes a time of questioning. The
German people will have reason to ask themselves
what has been done to them. The burdens
of taxes, the loss of commerce, the wrecks of
human life through maiming, and the great gaps
in population through death, all these things can
but come to the minds of the people. At that
time the press must lose something of its rigorous
control, for it is impossible that when the Germans
get over the feeling that their country is in
danger they will continue to tolerate a press
whose every word is dictated by the one thought
of keeping the people solidly united in war sentiment.
If it should happen that the empire has
an emperor who is not trusted by the people it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
may be that the questioning will sweep away
many old doubts and forms.</p>

<p>These things should not be taken as prophecy,
but as possibilities for tempering the opinion that
Germany is destined to be permanently autocratic.
The advocate of an enduring peace has
a right to think a self-governing Germany well
within the bounds of possibility before another
decade has elapsed. If such a thing happens,
certainly one of the most serious obstacles to
peace will have been removed.</p>

<p>I shall venture to put one more argument into
the mouth of the advocate of peace. Probably
he has not used it as I am going to use it, but it
works his way; for it shows that a tremendous
fate threatens, unless some coöperative movement
is established to avert it. Stated briefly it
is this: Through the ages runs a law of unification
in society, and it seems probable that the
world has today come to the point at which the
unifying force is likely to take a long stride forward,
a force which may operate in one of two
directions. I mean that with the next century
unification seems imminent by conquest, if not by
common consent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
It is not easy to say that the process of concentration
in human society is a law in the sense in
which there is law in natural science. But there
is a general social tendency, seemingly irrepressible,
operating steadily from the beginning of
history, for the political units to be larger and
ever larger. If this tendency is not a law it is an
extremely strong force; and we may well ask if it
is not about to take one of its great steps forward.</p>

<p>A glance at the past will show how the process
has gone on. In ancient times diminutive states
were absorbed by larger but still very small
states, which in turn were welded into so-called
confederacies, or leagues, which at last became
integrated states. The concentration went forward
in cycles, one empire rising in power until it
ruled most of its known world, and then it broke
into pieces through its lack of cohesive power.
Thus it was with Babylon, Assyria, Persia,
Greece, and Rome. Whenever the bubble burst
the process of unification began again immediately,
and on a larger scale. After the fall of
Rome it was again set in motion in an area that
included most of Europe, the unifying hand belonging
to Charlemagne, king of the Franks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
His personal valor won the triumph of his will,
but his empire fell away soon after he relaxed his
hold upon it.</p>

<p>Then began a rebuilding process. Feudal
states evolved out of clashing duchies, counties,
and bishoprics. Immediately feudal states began
to devour one another. With each century
the unit of government became larger. At last
rose the great power of Spain, so great that it
became a threat to other powers, and then followed
a series of wars to decide whether or not
Spain should be the supreme state in Europe,
and Spain lost. A century later France seemed
to be seeking to establish herself in the same kind
of supremacy, and again the combined force of
Europe was necessary to break her purposes.
Still later came the Napoleonic wars, in which
Europe seemed for a moment to be subjected by
one central will, but again it was saved through
great suffering. To some people it seemed that
the Napoleonic attempt would be the last.</p>

<p>Of these modern struggles in Europe it is seen
that each has been harder than the struggle that
preceded it. That is because in each the implements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
and organization of warfare were improved
as compared with the former struggle, and
because states were stronger and more capable of
endurance. It is also evident that each of these
great wars was the result of the ambition of one
sovereign, supported by a strong and well united
nobility, while in each case the most effective resistance
was offered by the states in which some
degree of self-government had been adopted.</p>

<p>The struggle that now exists is the highest
manifestation of this tendency to unification that
the world has seen since the fall of Rome. Although
Napoleon seemed at certain moments in
his career to stand nearer absolute success than
Germany now stands, he never really gained as
much as the kaiser now holds; for he won his successes
against the poorly trained and dispirited
troops of Prussia, Austria, and Spain, while the
Germans have won what they have won against
some of the best troops of history. Moreover,
Napoleon’s power was founded on his success
solely, while the German victories rest on
the long established and certain foundation of the
German empire. It seems reasonable to say that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Europe stands today nearer to unification than
it has stood since the fall of Charlemagne’s
power.</p>

<p>Two great combinations are fighting for mastery.
One has the avowed purpose of extending
its power until it is in a fair way to absorb the
rest of the states one after the other. The other
group fights to beat off the fate that threatens,
and it acknowledges that it cannot succeed unless
it crushes its opponents into such a state as will
take from them the desire and the power to attempt
another war for supremacy. Whichever
side wins, the other will feel an impulse to continue
to act in alliance. And we may have a
Europe of two great federal states, with the
little states at their mercy.</p>

<p>For example, how can Great Britain and
France ever be opponents again, as in the old
days? The sense of common sacrifices would of
itself make them more than friends, but the consciousness
that each depends on the other in dealing
with the great danger will never fail them,
and it will force them into some kind of political
union. In the same way, we should expect to
see a greatly altered relation between Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Britain and her colonies. Three-quarters of a
million of colonial defenders constitute a contribution
that demands reward. As the colonies
depend on the mother country for some important
elements of defense, and Great Britain cannot
comfort herself with the assurance of safety unless
she has a broad imperial power for its basis,
it would seem natural to expect some kind of imperial
union. As to Belgium, when she escapes
from the grasp of Germany, what mind has the
ingenuity to foresee her fate? If she relies on
the promise of neutralization, she is again tempting
fate. If she is annexed to France, with some
kind of autonomy, German enmity will be
aroused.</p>

<p>Probably her fate is to be bound up with the
fate of the other small states of Europe, states
which in the present war are hardly entirely
sovereign. Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, Greece, and Portugal have lost
something of the power to direct their internal
affairs. In war they have had a lesson of the
necessity of bending to the will of an external
government, which they will probably remember
many times in the days of peace. When once a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
state has yielded at the dictation of a neighbor,
and made money out of it, the next time it is
pressed yielding becomes an easier thing. The
fate of these small states in a possible era of fierce
competition between two great groups would be
very perplexing. In an era of peace through
federation, says the advocate of peace, it would
be much happier.</p>

<p>In short, it is a practical question that our
idealist puts to us. Here is a world that has gone
mad, shall it not turn to reason again? The old
system has broken down, shall we try to make it
work again? To do so will lead us to just the
disaster that now overwhelms us. Shall we
not try a plan which will not cost us in money
half what the old system of preparation cost, and
which if it fails cannot be more of a failure than
the old system has proved? If autocracy stands
in the way, let us hope that autocracy will give
way before the march of the spirit of the times.
And finally, the law of unification is working so
strongly in these days of international relations,
that we are at last at the point at which we
cannot longer elect to remain distinct in our national
activities. We must choose between a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
world state through conquest, and a world state
through mutual agreement. Which shall we
take? To try to go on with the states entirely
distinct, is to invite their conquest by a great
state.</p>

<span class="subhead">A FEDERATION OF NATIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Taking into consideration the obstacles and
the advantages summarized in the two preceding
chapters what are we going to do when the war
comes to an end? The easiest and most likely
thing is to adjust ourselves as quickly and quietly
as possible to the peace that is given to us, take
up the old problems of living as nearly as we can
where we left them in 1914&mdash;or in 1917, when
the war began for the United States&mdash;and trust
to our good stars to guide us to a happy haven.
But if there is one thing this war has shown, it
is that trusting to stars is not a safe protection
against war. The only thing sensible people
ought to count on in these days is the judgment
of their capable and efficient minds. And it
seems that the suggestion of the men who wish to
obtain peace by coöperation is worthy of the most
careful debate by men who have the best interest
of humanity at heart.</p>

<p>When the war ends it may be that the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
will not have arrived at the time when such a
scheme can be adopted, but we should not be
hasty in saying so. It is not a scheme to be disposed
of by newspaper editors, who rarely have
time to weigh the conditions of such a serious matter,
or of senators and representatives, whose
views arise out of party interests, or of high
officials as a class, who are usually overburdened
with administrative matters. It is a thing for
all the people to consider, and in order that it
may have the fairest and most conspicuous hearing,
there should be a great world congress, not
composed of theorists merely, but of the most
practical statesmen, who will take up the matter
in a spirit of friendliness, with the intention of
adopting the scheme if it can be received in a
manner that warrants the hope of success.</p>

<p>Every nation in the world has reason to desire
the establishment of an enduring peace; but the
United States has a larger interest in such an
issue of the war than any other nation. Since we
became a nation we have gone on developing
along peaceful lines. Having had no reason to
fear our neighbors and being so remote from
Europe that we were not likely to be molested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
from that part of the world, we formed our institutions
on the basis of peace. Our public ideals,
our sense of citizenship, the aims of our law-making
have all been such as are natural for a nation
that has nothing to fear from external enemies.</p>

<p>One result of the present war is to relegate
these ideals into the junk-heap of institutions, unless
we can be assured that peace is a certainty.
Under a system of competition between states we
cannot afford to be less ready for war than any
other great nation. We must have a large navy
and a great army ready to meet the blows of any
power that feels that it has reason to interfere
with our peaceful development. We must become
a militaristic republic, a thing which seems
against nature. When such an attempt has been
made in the past, the result has been an oligarchy.
In the United States it would probably lead to a
sad clash of social classes mingled with vicious
party politics and timidity in the national legislature.
And yet, under a continuation of the old
system it would be folly to endeavor to get along
without an army and navy large enough to protect
us from the initial swoop of some powerful
adversary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
If from this fate the advocate of coöperation
can offer an escape, it behooves us to listen to
his scheme. We should weigh it carefully and
be willing to take some kind of a chance to secure
its adoption, if in it there is the possibility of successful
operation.</p>

<p>To be perfectly fair to those who suggest
leagues or federations we should remember that
we are not dealing with the ideas of pacifists, as
such. The schemes that are set forth by the
friends of lasting peace come from men who are
giving all their energies to the prosecution of the
war. They believe, as much as any of us, that
the war should be pressed with every ounce of the
nation’s strength. They are fighting as hard as
any one in the country, and they desire the defeat
of Germany as much as any soldier or statesman
in the world. They are fighting to establish a
basis on which the peace of the world can be built.
They are not cranks, and even if they are mistaken,
they are honestly trying to call mankind
to the better way.</p>

<p>One of their suggestions is a league of peace,
to be composed of the civilized nations. As we
have seen, it is loosely organized and does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
allow the central authority of the league enough
power to punish a state that tries to withdraw
from the league. Nor does it grant the central
authority the right to punish a state which, after
submitting its case to the proposed tribunal of
arbitration and losing the decision, decides to go
to war in defiance of the tribunal’s judgment.
What would Germany do, for example, if she
had lost such a judgment and did not wish to
accept her defeat? Strong and well prepared
for war, she might disregard all respect for the
opinion of the world, if she felt that her future
was at stake, and we can hardly doubt that her
own people would support her.</p>

<p>Connected with the idea of a league is the plan,
advocated by those who place respect for law
above all other considerations, for creating a high
court of judicature, with judges selected from all
nations, which shall have authority to try and
give judgment on all disputes of nations. As a
part of a strongly organized federation such a
court would have great influence, but if it existed
under a league it could hardly have enough
authority to secure the obedience of the great
states. As for the small states, they never give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
trouble any how, except as they act in association
with some great state, or as they are threatened
by some great power. No union for peace can
accomplish its object that does not deal with the
great states, and any scheme suggested may leave
the small states out of consideration. On the
other hand, the small states are deeply interested
in forming such a union, since it would give them
a safety they could hardly get otherwise.</p>

<p>The proposed plans for a league of peace and
for an international court of arbitration were announced
before the war or in its early stages.
They were made with an eye to the most that
the nations could be induced to give up of their
control over their own actions. It is possible that
their authors would not follow the same plans if
they were forced to make them today. The war
has shown us several things. It has revealed
Germany’s reason for opposing steadily all the
real peace plans at the Hague conferences. It
has shown us what fate awaits the world after
the war, unless there is a return to reason and
coöperation. It is possible that in writing out
a plan for peace today the gentlemen who met in
Carpenters’ Hall, Philadelphia, in June, 1915,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
would feel justified in supporting a stronger
proposition.</p>

<p>Mr. H.&nbsp;N. Brailsford, in a book called <cite>A
League of Nations</cite>, London, 1917, announces the
outline of a working scheme, which he hopes the
friends of peace will consider. Its chief features
are: 1. An international court of justice to consider
and pass on justiciable cases, with a council
of conciliation to pass on non-justiciable cases,
and a pledge by the states that they will not make
war nor mobilize their troops until the court or
council has within a stipulated time passed on the
several matters in dispute. 2. An executive of
the league to take steps, military or economic,
to enforce the obligations of the members of the
league. 3. The guarantee of the right of secession
together with the possibility of expelling a
state. 4. A consideration of disarmament on
land and sea. 5. An international commission
to see that all the signatory powers have access to
raw material in manufactures, with a pledge to
permit trading among themselves without discrimination
and to follow the “open door” policy
in trade with the undeveloped regions of the
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
In this scheme we see the influence of the war.
The author is brought to see that some form of
central authority to coërce a state is necessary.
On the other hand, he does not allow his league
to become a law-making body, an omission that
goes far to weaken the united efforts of the
league. Guaranteeing the right of secession, also
shows that the author of the plan is unwilling to
merge the nations into a great state, in which they
will each give up a portion of their sovereignty.
His plan is a little stronger than the American
plan but it nevertheless falls short of being a federation.</p>

<p>If we are to make a serious attempt to obtain
enduring peace by coöperation it behooves us to
start on the basis of sufficient force to insure
that the attempt will be worth while. If that
cannot be done, it is unwise to make the attempt,
since to trust ourselves at this juncture to that
which we have good reason to believe insufficient
only lulls us to a false sense of security and dissipates
resolution that might with better effect
be used in an opposite direction. If we do not
have peace through coöperation we must maintain
a sharp state of preparation for war.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Furthermore, no people can be rallied to a scheme
which seems insufficient to them. Give them that
which they can trust and they can perhaps be
made to support it, in spite of the inconveniences
they find in it.</p>

<p>Probably it is not too much to say that the only
form of united action that can be relied on is a
federation with enough cohesive force to guard
against secession, repress any constituent state
that defies the united will, make laws that concern
the purposes for which the federation is formed,
exercise the right of interpreting those laws by a
system of federal courts, and maintain an executive
that can make itself obeyed. It need not
have these extensive functions for all the areas of
government, but it should have them for those
things that concern the declaration of war and the
preservation of peace. It means that to escape
an era of conflict ending, perhaps, in a world
united through conquest as the Roman Empire
was united, we establish by agreement a world
united through federation, as the United States
of America were united. A league of nations,
under the plans suggested above, would be only
a half-way house that would lead to rupture and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
failure or to some future struggle out of which
a world taught by experience might possibly form
“a more perfect union.”</p>

<p>Some of the fundamental ideas of a federation
were embodied, as we have seen, in the plans of
the Abbé St. Pierre and the philosopher, Kant.
Living at a time when the state was conceived as
the seat of power, they trusted to force to execute
the will of the suggested government that was to
provide peace. Bentham, however, was deeply
impressed with morality as a force for good government,
and he was willing to trust his proposed
system to the reasonable impulses of men. To
him it is possible to reply that if men were so
reasonable that they would respect an agreement
to settle disputes by arbitration, they would be
reasonable enough to avoid the differences which
run into such disputes. In our modern world
reason thrives best when it is reënforced by authority.</p>

<p>The attempt of Alexander I, of Russia, to obtain
some practical realization of the principle of
a federated Europe in behalf of peace followed
these lines as closely as could be expected, but, it
must be confessed, in a very lame way. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
failure of his efforts has been taken as proof that
the idea is impracticable. But it does not follow
that it is impracticable to the same extent and
in the same way today as in 1815. No Metternich
now controls the policy of the majority of
the European courts. Republican institutions
exist to an appreciable extent in most of them.
The mind of Europe is more nearly a unit today
than a century ago, and commerce, travel, and
international sympathy bind nations together as
never before. Moreover all these unifying forces
are growing rapidly. When the feeling engendered
by the war subsides, and it always does
subside after a war, the nations will be more conscious
of one another and less willing to challenge
one another than before they engaged in
the present appalling struggle. In these things
there is a hope that the federation of Europe for
the preservation of peace would be more possible
than in the times of Metternich. I do not mean
that all obstacles are removed, but they are fewer
than formerly.</p>

<p>Considering these things I find myself driven,
in closing my essay, to a serious examination
of the possibility of creating a world federation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
out of the chaos that now floats over the
globe&mdash;not an integrated world empire, with
power over all phases of political action, but a
federation that will have authority to regulate the
forces that make for war. If such a thing could
be created and accepted by the states of the world,
it would make the present struggle, with all its
horrors, the best and most fortunate event that
has come to humanity since the beginning of the
Christian era. If the war should result in the
thorough defeat of the present régime in Germany,
followed by the creation of a world federation
into which Germany should be forced to
come, with her pride so reduced that she could
be kept obedient to the federation until the virus
of world power should get out of her system, the
world would have passed a milestone in civilization,
and for our part in it future generations
would thank us to the end of time.</p>

<p>The organization of the American Union in
1787&ndash;1789 was a similar process on a smaller
scale. So many of its features are analogous to
conditions that suggest themselves in connection
with the proposition of a world federation that it
is worth while to recall them. If we are not led<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
to conclude that a similar step should be taken
at this time in the larger sphere, we shall at least
have a clearer idea of what such a federation
would mean, and it may happen that we shall
conclude that it is not so difficult a thing to establish
as appears on first sight.</p>

<p>Before the war for independence the American
colonies it is true, were not as separate as the
present European states, but they were so distinct
in their ideals and purposes that no one
thought their union possible. When Franklin
proposed a very mild sort of concentration in
1754 his suggestion was rejected in the colonies
because it involved the surrender of some of the
colonial separateness. Had no pressure come
from the outside it is difficult to see what would
have forced the thirteen colonies to come together.</p>

<p>The external pressure was the conviction that
Great Britain was about to adopt a policy by
which the interests of the colonies would be subservient
to the interests of British traders, thus
destroying their partially avowed hope of a distinctly
American policy. Then came seven years
of war and four years of fear lest Great Britain
should recover through American dissension<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
what she had lost in the trial of arms. Under
such conditions the newly liberated states were
willing to form the American union.</p>

<p>A similar pressure on the nations will exist in
the burden of preparedness and the danger of a
renewal of the present struggle. The last three
years of conflict are more burdensome to the
world than the seven years of the American revolution
to the states engaged against Great Britain.
Moreover, the danger of chaotic conditions
in the future is as great as the danger that confronted
the Americans in 1787. Every period is
a critical period in history, but that which follows
the present struggle is especially important.</p>

<p>When our revolution ended a majority of our
people thought the old system good enough.
The men&mdash;and there were many of them&mdash;who
pointed out the advantages to the western world
of a great federated state were pronounced idealists.
“Practical” men meant to go on living in
a “practical” way. But the idealists were led by
Washington, Madison, and Hamilton, and the
logic of events came to their aid. Dissensions
appeared, taxes were not paid, and the national
debt seemed on the verge of repudiation. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
the country was willing to listen to the idealists;
and the American federated state was established.</p>

<p>It was received with derision by the publicists
of Europe. They could not believe that republican
government would succeed in an area as large
as that of the thirteen states. Their fears were
not realized and today most of their descendants
live under republican government of some form
or other. We should not blame them too much.
They had never seen republican government operated
on a large scale, and they were not able
to imagine that it could operate on a large
scale. If they could have seen it working with
their mind’s eye, they would have had confidence
in its operation. The Americans were accustomed
to using their imagination, and seeing the
“experiment” working in their imagination, they
could adopt it and make it work.</p>

<p>The greatest obstacle to “federation” in the
American constitutional convention was the jealousy
of small states toward the large states.
Since it would have been unwise to leave any
state out of the proposed system, the small states
were in a position to make demands. When they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
were allowed equality in the senate they became
quite reasonable. This obstacle could hardly
exist in the formation of a great federation for
the elimination of war; for the small states would
probably be the first to accept such a plan, as our
small states were most willing to adopt our constitution,
once it was prepared. It would give
them as perfect security as they could desire,
and without such a guaranty their continued existence
is always precarious.</p>

<p>Next to the fears of the small states was the
unwillingness of many people in the states to give
up the idea that only a state should control the
happiness of its citizens, and that the union, if
formed, would destroy or lessen individual liberty.
This idea inhered in whatever idea of state
sovereignty the people of the day held. To form
a federation to enforce peace would undoubtedly
limit to some extent the sovereignty of the present
states of Europe. But sovereignty in itself is
worth nothing. It exists to give in general some
forms of life and dignity to states. If a surrender
of part of a state’s sovereignty will give
that state immunity from wars perpetually, is it
not sovereignty well exchanged? No American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
state suffered because it gave up control over its
right to make war, but, on the contrary, it gained
immensely. Such a right is a costly necessity, a
thing to be held tenaciously as long as we are in
a condition which makes wars necessary, but to
be given up as quickly as we can do without it.</p>

<p>To enter a federation would mean that individual
nations would give up the right to expand
their territories. Germany could not acquire
more territory under such a system, unless she
got it by agreement of the parties concerned.
The British empire could become no larger by
any forceful process. But this would not be a
hardship. The only real justification of expansion
is to enlarge trade areas. A federation to
eliminate war would necessarily adopt a policy
which allowed all states an “open door” in trade.
This was one of the essential things in the formation
of our union; for we read that no state shall
interfere within its borders with the rights of the
citizens of other states to trade there. Under
such circumstances territorial expansion becomes
useless.</p>

<p>When the American states were trying to form
that simple kind of union that was expressed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
the articles of confederation, Maryland long refused
to join. She was jealous of the great size
of her neighbors and especially of Virginia,
whose claim to the Northwest was in general not
disputed. Experience showed that her fears
were groundless. Virginia not only never became
a menace to Maryland, but she soon realized
that her wide boundaries were worthless to her
under a system which guaranteed her against
quarrels with her neighbors, and as a result she
surrendered her Northwestern lands. Under a
federation an undeveloped part of Asia or Africa
would be open as freely to Germans as to others
for trade, settlement, and the happiness of life,
just as our Northwest was open to Virginians,
Pennsylvanians, and New Englanders alike.
The only thing that Virginia gave up in relinquishing
her lands was the right to call herself a
big state, that is, self-glorification, a thing the
nations would have to give up in a federation.
But might it not be well exchanged for the right
to call themselves safe from warfare?</p>

<p>When the American constitution was being debated
the small states declared they would not
“federate” unless they were given privileges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
which guaranteed them against absorption by the
large states, while the large states declared they
would not “federate” unless it was arranged that
the small states should not have the power to defeat
measures that were for the common good.
Each side was very honest in suspecting the other,
and great patience and persistence were necessary
to bring them together in a compromise which
gave neither what it at first demanded. For
us it is interesting to observe that in actual practice
there has never been a time when the large
states seemed to threaten to devour the small
states, nor a time when the small states placed
their welfare against any measure that concerned
the general good of the country. The union
formed, the people began to debate questions that
had nothing to do with this or that state, general
policies that cut across great sections of the federation,
without regard to the states as such.</p>

<p>It seems that if a federation of Europe were
once formed a development might be expected of
a somewhat similar nature. At least, it is not
unlikely that the clashes predicted by the doubters
would not be as violent as they fear. It
seems certain that at once a new class of issues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
would engage the minds of the politicians, issues
that would spring from the general interests that
were conceived essential to life in the new grouping.
It is not possible to say what clashes might
grow out of these general issues, but it is probable
that the genius of man would be as competent to
take care of them as to direct the issues that
will arise if the world goes on under a system
like that now in use; for clashes we must have in
any event. After all, humanity has to manage
its own problems, and there will never be a government
under which it will not have all it can
do to make the doubts of today resolve themselves
into the confidence of tomorrow.</p>

<p>In our American constitution-making one
often heard the question, “What will become of
the liberties of the citizen of the state under the
federation?” The answer was well made at the
time: “Will not the citizen of the state still be the
citizen of the state, and will not the state continue
to guarantee him all that it can now guarantee
him? Does he not also pass under the protection
of the federation as truly as the citizens of any of
the states? All that the federation proposes to
do is to take charge of the functions that concern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
the things for which the federation is founded,
and these are things to which the states are not
so well adjusted as a united government.” And
so it proved in practice. No American has ever
had reason to think his liberty lessened because
the union was formed; and he has been immensely
stronger in all his rights on the high seas, in traveling
abroad, in being safe from the burdens of
foreign wars, and in his rights of trade in the uttermost
parts of the earth; for he has been the
citizen of a great federation of small states.</p>

<p>Applying the analogy to the suggested federation
of the world it appears that under such a
system the citizen of France, Great Britain, Russia,
or the United States would in nowise lose his
rights under his own government, and he would
gain vastly in relief from burdens. He would
no longer have to think of wars, his trade relations
would be adjusted in such a way that no
other man could have what he did not have. In
short, for all the purposes for which the federation
was founded he would stand on equal footing
with any other man, and for the purposes for
which his own state existed he would have all the
rights he had before. His only losses would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
in casting off the burdens that grow out of international
rivalry under the present system.</p>

<p>One of the things for which the American
union was created was the payment of the revolutionary
debts. Compared with the debts the
colony had incurred individually before the revolution,
and compared with their ability to pay
them at the time, these debts were large, although
they proved, under the union, a very small burden.
It was the sense of security under a government
which had eliminated the possibility of
interstate wars that made the burden light.</p>

<p>The amount of indebtedness that the several
nations in the present war have contracted seems
appalling. It would become a comparatively
light burden, if we could feel that for the future
the world had nothing to do but to pay it. The
waste of interstate rivalry, the burden of preparations
for future wars, the loss to industry through
uncertainties on account of wars, all these things
would disappear from the consideration of the
financiers, the credit of a federated world would
become excellent, and bonds that are likely to be
quoted very low when the artificial stimulus they
get from patriotism is taken away would be considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
better investments than any bonds ever
offered under the existing system of states. The
capitalists of the world, like the American capitalists
of 1787&ndash;1789, should be the most earnest
supporters of federation.</p>

<p>In the United States a great deal has been said
about “entangling alliances.” As the term was
used a century ago it meant an alliance that was
likely to make us parties to the quarrels of European
states, one against the other. Into such a
maze of selfish maneuvers it would never be well
for us to enter. But to take our place in a federation
to preserve peace would be quite another
thing. That it would pledge us to the discharge
of a duty is not to be doubted; but we should be
entering no intrigue. We should be doing the
most patriotic thing possible; for the very essence
of the act would be to protect ourselves
from the possibility of being drawn into “entangling
alliances” with Europe. Let us suppose
that the old system is continued, and that
Germany has a mind to pay off what she may
consider an old score. Suppose she tries to set
Mexico up against us, or to induce Japan to
attack the Philippines, or to interfere with any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
weaker American government in such a way as
to threaten the integrity of the Monroe doctrine,
have we not an “entangling alliance” on hand?
If Germany emerges from the present war strong
enough to threaten the world as before the war,
when other nations found it necessary to form
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ententes</i> against her, we shall not dare remain
outside of some kind of alliance that will be
formed to check her pretensions. World federation
is the guaranty against the formation of
“entangling alliances” on the part of the United
States.</p>

<p>In drawing the parallels between the formation
of our union and the possible creation of a
federation of nations, it is hard to avoid the inference
that the two systems lead to the same end,
federated general government. And yet they
are not the same. Our union was created to take
over a large area of government which the individual
states could not conduct successfully. It
has a direct bearing on the citizens of the states,
it even has its own citizenship, although it was a
long time after 1787 before it was defined. It
has popular elections, a postal system, and hundreds
of other things which no one would allot to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
the kind of federation discussed here. It has
been cited only for the argument that can legitimately
be derived from analogous conditions relating
to the difficulties of forming the union.</p>

<p>A world federation, on the other hand, could
have only one main purpose, the preservation of
peace. No other bonds should knit it together
except those which exist for that purpose. They
would be strong enough for the strain that would
be put upon them, and no stronger. They would
be made for a specific object by persons who
would be careful that they were properly made.
A federation of this kind could not be adopted
until it was approved by the authorities in the
constituent nations, which would guarantee that
it did not sacrifice the individuality of those
nations. In fact, so great would be the obstacles
at this point that it is safe to say that there would
be more danger that the federation would be too
weak rather than that it would be too strong.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Here ends this statement of the arguments for
the only possible plan of coöperation that will, if
adopted, give the world enduring peace. It
would be easier to form a league to enforce peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
by arbitration and moral suasion than to form a
federation with power sufficient to enforce its
decrees. But a league would in all probability
be flouted by the states as often as their interests
seemed to them to make it advisable. Reverting
to the analogy of our own formative period in
national government, a league would be like our
articles of confederation, weak and insufficient
because they did not authorize the central government
to coërce a recalcitrant state. As a step
toward a more desirable end the articles of federation
were worth while: as a similar step a
league of nations might be better than nothing,
but it would not lead to the end to which the
world is looking.</p>

<p>The idea of a federation of nations has been
behind many a philosopher’s dream. Jesus
looked forward to it when he offered the world
“my peace,” and many another has held that
somewhere in the shadowy future a millennial era
of super-government and peace will fall upon
the earth. It would be a great thing if at this
day we could take a step toward the realization
of an ideal whose universality attests its desirability.
The “fruits of Waterloo” were lost a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
century ago by a wide margin, due to the less perfect
comprehension the world then had of the
advantages of federated peace. If they are lost
at the end of this war it will be by a smaller
discrepancy. Some time they will be secured,
not because men have dreamed of them; but because,
in such a case at least, dreams are but “suppressed
desires.”</p>

<p>The writer of a book can do no more than raise
his voice to the people who do things. To that
large class who make things happen he can only
give impulse and hope. His cry goes to those
who govern, to those who direct the press, and to
all citizens who feel responsibility for the formation
of good public opinion. If he speaks to
them faithfully and without prejudice or mere
enthusiasm, he has done all he can do. The results
are on the knees of the gods.</p>

<p class="p1">Back in the middle of the last century there was a greater
demand for history than today, when there are more historians.
Sparks, Bancroft, Prescott and Motley as well as
Col. Peter Force, the compiler, brought to their work a
patriotic fervour touched with literary genius which made
their histories works of literature and themselves distinguished
figures in a distinguished past. It is of them and
their conception of the historical tradition that Prof. Bassett
writes, linking their lives to what they lived to make&mdash;the
history of their country’s early days.</p>

<p>Because a new conception of the study of history has
come into being in recent years, and we now have the
product of research in endless archives replacing the fervent
eloquence of the nineteenth century historians, Professor
Bassett’s book will be welcome as an appreciative study of
a worthy fragment of our national growth, a history of
history.</p>

Professor Bassett, who is acknowledged to be one of the foremost
American historians.</p>

<p>“The book, while it is one of the best textbooks on the subject

</p>

<p class="p1">In the Elementary History of the United States, Dr. Bassett
has treated the significant facts of our national history in a
manner that appeals strongly to the interest of young readers
and in language that can be readily understood by children
even in the intermediate grades. With its story book qualities,
the book combines a treatment intended to convey to the child
the fundamental facts and becomes a history book that takes
the place of a book of juvenile fiction. It presents the facts
accurately and effectively with sense and proportion. In this
treatment the social life of our people, the economic conditions
of the country, and the general welfare of the people as they
have appeared, are presented in a most desirable form.</p>

<p class="p1">This is a one-volume edition of a biography that has, since
its first publication several years ago, come to be regarded as
one of the most faithful stories of Jackson’s life and of its effect
on the nation that has ever been written. Professor Bassett
has not slighted Jackson’s failings or his virtues; he has tried
to refrain from commenting upon his actions; he has sought to
present a true picture of the political manipulations which surrounded
Jackson and in which he was an important factor.
The volume contributes largely to a clearer realization not only
of the character of a great man but also of the complex period
in which he lived.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
